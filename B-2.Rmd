# 2: Foundations of Human Sexuality {.unnumbered}

## 2.1 - Introduction {.unnumbered}

The realm of human sexuality is difficult to circumnavigate because it is as much ruled by non-rational elements of human experience - desire and emotion - as it is by phenomenon that can be reduced to rational and replicable patterns. Every person's sexuality is uniquely shaped by his or her individual make-up; intra-psychic influences as well as by collective influences. To truly understand the foundations of human sexuality, one must develop an understanding of the interplay between individual, physiological, psychological, theological, sociological, and cultural elements - as well as develop an ability to look at the interpretations of these elements objectively and compassionately. This takes time and experience. So, be patient with your process of working with the material in Unit B Section 2. Be open to thinking critically about the ideas put forth in the material, and take time to reflect and develop  your response to it.

Our look at the foundations of human sexuality is divided into four categories:

-   Section 2.2  Influences of Culture and Society
-   Section 2.3  Sex and Gender Identity
-   Section 2.4  Psychological Theories of Sexuality
-   Section 2.5  Sexual Response
-   Section 2.6  Sexuality and the Life Cycle

## 2.2 - Influences of Culture and Society {.unnumbered}

### Influences of Culture {.unnumbered}

Human sexuality is viewed differently throughout the world. For example, the belief system of people living in North America differs widely from belief systems of peoples in other parts of the world. Many regard the North American view of human sexuality as too liberal, and others believe it too conservative. Differences in sexual tolerance between peoples are influenced by many factors - religious or spiritual, governmental, moral, cultural, etc. Individually and as groups, people have multiple moral investments in their expressions of sexuality that are shaped by scientific, medical, technological, and governmental discourses (Pigg and Adams, 2005, p. 1). To better serve her clientele it is important for the Justisse Holistic Reproductive Health Practitioner trainee to develop a foundational understanding of these differences. Cultural, ethnic, religious, and/or social influences uniquely shape each client's reproductive health needs.

North American attitudes towards human sexuality have undergone significant transformation since the late 19th and 20th centuries as you learned in Unit A. Some movements responsible for this transformation, and influencing change in perceptions of sexuality today include:

-   Feminism and women's movements
-   The sexual revolution, gay rights movement, and same sex marriage debates
-   Developments in understanding and managing Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs)
-   Individualism

**Required Reading**

-   Adams, V., & Pigg, S. L. (2005). Introduction: The moral object of sex. In _Sex in development: Science, sexuality, and morality in global perspective._ London, UK: Duke University Press.

Sex in Development examines how development projects around the world intended to promote population management, disease prevention, and maternal and child health intentionally and unintentionally shape ideas about what constitutes “normal” sexual practices and identities. … \[the book\] combines the cultural analysis of sexuality, critiques of global development, and science and technology studies.

### Feminism and Women's Movements {.unnumbered}

From the late 1800s on, an emerging women's movement has resulted in greater and increasing participation of women in the workplace, government, and international organizing. Feminism means different things to different groups of women, but generally it is responsible for consciousness raising regarding inequity in societal gender norms, and instilling in women a sense of personal empowerment and responsibility. Feminists since the movement began have sought to safeguard civil rights, open up opportunities for women in the workplace and in politics, secure women's rights to bodily autonomy, work toward wage equality, expose gender bias in healthcare, etc, etc, etc.

**Pause to ponder these questions:**

-   What are some goals important to women's rights and freedoms in your community? your country?
-   What has the been the most influential feminist/women's movement in your community? your country?
-   When did women in your country gain the legal right to vote? to go to university? to have access to abortion? to be paid a wage equal to men for the same work?
-   How are black, indigenous, and others persons of color (BIPOC) included or excluded in the feminist dialog? in your country? in your region?
-   How are people who do not identify as a woman included or excluded in the feminist dialog?

An important component of feminism has been to write women's contributions back into historical records that have been dominated with the perspectives of men. [The National Women's History Project](http://www.nwhp.org/)  in the United States is one such initiative celebrating the historic accomplishments of women. Check out their brief history of the mainstream women's rights movement in the United States from 1948 - 1998.

**Required Reading**

-   Eisenberg, B., & Ruthsdotter, M. (1998). [Chapter 2 In Living the legacy: The women's rights movement (1949 - 1998)](https://justisse.ca/MediaGallery/HRHP%20Documents/HRHP/UnitB/Eisenberg%20and%20Ruthsdotter.pdf) _National Women's History Project._ 

If you prefer to read about history other than the USA then find a source and share it with your trainer.  Ask yourself, how have women's organizing movements impacted your society? Please share any resources on the history of women's movements in your area with your HRHP Educator. 

**Pause to ponder these questions:**

-   What women are you aware of from your community or your country who have been erased from history?
-   What women are you aware of from your community or your country who have been reinstated into history?

### The Sexual Revolution {.unnumbered}

During the 1960's sexual revolution many fought for freedom to express their sexuality and expand accepted notions of 'normal' sexual practice. The result was a radical shift in how people perceive human sexuality, which pervades our culture today. In 1965, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) mandated sex education as part of public school curricula. In 1973, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) removed homosexuality from its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of mental disorders (DSM-IV), which furthered efforts to promote sexual individuality. However, discrimination and persecution of people who do not conform to heterosexuality occurs still in North America.

While the Minister of Justice, former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Elliot Trudeau changed the currents of the Canadian nation when, in the late 1960s, he made what became a famous statement: “The state has no business in the bedrooms of the nation.” New or revised governmental and legal jurisdictions continue to reflect movement toward the liberation of sexuality in North America, as evidenced by the debate in Canada over the legalization of same sex marriage, and the continued controversies around same sex marriage in the U.S. 

**Pause to ponder these questions:**

-   Can you identify a discrete sexual revolution in your community or your country?
-   How are you part of a sexual revolution? or not?
-   What does sexual revolution mean to you?

### Same Sex Marriage {.unnumbered}

The Danish (Denmark) were the first to grant **same-sex unions** almost the exact same rights as marriages, with its [Registered Partnerships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_union "Civil union") Act of 1989. However, the law stopped short of calling same-sex unions "marriages," and couples could not be married in the Danish state church or adopt a child.  Even so, the law was viewed as an important stepping stone at the time.

In 2000, the Netherlands (Dutch) law went further than Denmark's, effectively eliminating any distinction at all between heterosexual and homosexual marriage, thus legalizing **same-sex-marriage**. 

Same sex marriage was ruled legal in Canada in July 2005, making Canada the fourth country in the world to legalize same-sex marriages nationwide (Makarenko, 2007, para. 1). For a timeline of this process see **['Same-sex rights in Canada'](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/timeline-same-sex-rights-in-canada-1.1147516)** by CBC News. The journey toward legality has been long and varied. Many voices were part of the debate; the readings below will give you a good overview of the many perspectives involved.   

**Pause to ponder these questions:**

-   How are members of the LGBTQ+ society treated and respected in your community? your country?
-   Is gay marriage legal in your community? your country?

Please share resources on the LGBTQ+ rights and freedoms movement in your area with your HRHP Educator.

### Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI) {.unnumbered}

Since the 1980s an increased awareness about the incidence of sexually transmitted infections (STI), particularly Hepatitis and HIV/AIDS, has affected how individuals view sexual intercourse, sexual freedom, and sexual health. As a result, barrier methods of birth control once used for contraception have now become instrumental in preventing the spread of these diseases. You will learn more about specific STIs in [Unit G Section 12.4](https://justisse.ca/index.php/college/courseware/page/1574) The required readings below examine the unexpected and anticipated impact of HIV/AIDS on sexuality.

**Pause to ponder these questions:**

-   How has HIV/AIDS impacted your country or region?
-   What biases or prejudices are associated with HIV/AIDS in your country or region?

Please share your reflections on additional literature with your HRHP Educator.


### Increased Focus on Individual Sexuality {.unnumbered}

Increased reproductive options because of new reproductive and contraceptive technologies, as well as some of the other sociological transformations discussed above provide individuals with a somewhat increased opportunity to express their sexuality, and manage their fertility as they choose. For example, this is seen in the changing idea of family. The [“traditional” family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_values) - with a mother and father overseeing the care of their children - is the minority. Many children are raised in single parent households, and some by same-sex parents, and many by parents who both work outside of the home.

**Pause to ponder these questions:**

-   What might appear in the intersection of opportunity to express individual sexuality and the ability to do so?
-   How safe is it in your community? your country? to express individual sexuality?
-   What biases or prejudices are associated with sexual expression in your country or region?

Please share your reflections on additional literature with your HRHP Educator.

 Comment on the dynamics of the McGarry family described below.  Consider: What events have each generation of the McGarrys experienced in their lifetime generally, and concerning the progression towards the right for a person to express their unique sexual identity? How will this have affected their views on sexuality? Record your thoughts in your journal.  The McGarrys will provide us with more opportunities for reflection throughout Unit B.

The McGarrys are a, Catholic family living in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. Parents Pat and Angela McGarry, both in their late 40s, lived through the sexual revolution - although they were both children at the time. They feel they are liberal in their beliefs on sexuality, but they do not condone same-gender pairings or birth control, except as outlined by their church's doctrine.

The McGarrys have three children: Marci, Michael, and Joseph. Their daughter Marci has a very different perspective on sexuality. Although she is also a practicing Catholic, she has been sexually attracted to women for some time. She is frightened of “coming out” because of her parents' views. Michael is a practicing lawyer, and Joseph is a priest.

The family's 83-year-old grandmother, Maggie, recently moved into a long term care senior's residence. Her husband passed away some time ago, and the family feels that the social interaction will “do her good.”

## 2.3 - Sex and Gender Identity {.unnumbered}

### Sex / Gender [1][2] {.unnumbered}

The term **gender** refers to the social or cultural attributes of being assigned the identity of woman or man or non-binary person. The term **sex** refers specifically to the biologically determined attributes of the female or male. Although gender and sex are used synonymously colloquially, they are conceptualized separately in sex research, and more so in social and academic discourse.

**Gender** is the range of characteristics pertaining to, and differentiating between, masculinity and femininity. Depending on the context, these characteristics may include biological sex (i.e., the state of being male, female, or an intersex variation), sex-based social structures (i.e., gender roles), or gender identity.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender#cite_note-udry-1)[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender#cite_note-haig-2) Most cultures use a gender binary, having two genders (boys/men) and (girls/women)[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender#cite_note-Nadal-re-binary-4) those who exist outside these groups fall under the umbrella term non-binary. Some societies have specific genders besides "man" and "woman" and may be referred to as _third genders_ and even _fourth genders_ and so forth. One such example is the [Hirjas of South Asia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijra_(South_Asia)) In [Hindu mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_themes_in_Hindu_mythology) it is common for the gender of gods, goddesses, and demons to be fluid and mercurial. Among some North American Indigenous peoples, the term ["two-spirited"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-spirit) is used to refer to those whose gender is fluid. Gender variance is not new to human society in general, but may be an uncomfortable reality for certain cultural and religious groups. 

Sexologist [John Money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Money "John Money") introduced the terminological distinction between biological sex and gender as a role in 1955. Before his work, it was uncommon to use the word _gender_ to refer to anything but grammatical categories.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender#cite_note-udry-1)[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender#cite_note-haig-2) Money's meaning of the word become widespread in the 1970s, when feminist theory embraced the concept of a distinction between biological sex and the social construct of gender, and to this day Money's meaning is followed, especially in the social sciences[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender#cite_note-socialsciencedictionary-5)[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender#cite_note-pearsonhighered-6) , as well as in documents created by the World Health Organization (WHO).[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender#cite_note-www.who.int-3)

**Sex is determined by 5 biological factors:** chromosomes, gonads, prenatal hormones, internal organs, and external genital appearance. These factors dictate whether a person will be assigned the identity of boy or girl at birth, but they do not dictate a person's private, internal sense of femaleness or maleness **\[1\]**.

Sex develops in a genetically encoded manner in utero. Gender identity develops extra-utero (after birth), and may not be the same as the person's sex. **Gender identity** refers to our own identification and internal sense of being a female, or male, or non-binary or woman or man and so forth. Gender identity develops throughout our experience of living with the ways the world reflects our gender back to us by its concepts of expected behaviour for our sex or assumed gender. Some individuals experience the worldly reflection of themselves in conflict with their internalized gender identity. This may be expressed, for example, by persons who are transgender, and/or homosexual. 

### Atypical Sexual Differentiation {.unnumbered}

In Unit C we address the phonomena of homologous organs and the process of the typical sexual differentiation of the female and male. To iterate, when an organ in the male and an organ in the female both develop from the same embryonic tissue, the organs are said to be homologous. When two organs have similar functions, they are said to be analogous. For example, ovaries and testes are both homologous (they develop from an undifferentiated gonad) and analogous (they produce gametes and sex hormones). 

Prenatal sexual differentiation is not as binary as is commonly assumed -- that all females will have sex chromosomes XX and will have a clitoris, vagina, uterus, and ovaries; and that all males will have sex chromosomes XY and will have a penis, testes, and scrotum; and have sex chromosomes XY. The last several decades of research challenges these assumptions and provide evidence for **eight variables of gender** **\[9\]**.

1.  Chromosomal gender: XX in the female; XY in the male
2.  Gonadal gender: Ovaries in the female; testes in the male
3.  Prenatal hormonal gender
    1.  Testosterone and MIS in the male but not the female before birth
    2.  Prenatal and neonatal brain differentiation where testosterone is present for masculinization, absent for feminization 
4.  Internal organs: Fallopian tubes, uterus, and upper vagina in the female; prostate and seminal vesicles in the male
5.  External genital appearance: Clitoris, inner and outer lips, and vaginal opening in the female; penis and scrotum in the male
6.  Pubertal hormonal gender: At puberty, estrogen and progesterone in the female; testosterone in the male
7.  Assigned gender: The announcement at birth, "It's a girl" or "It's a boy," based on the appearance of the external genitals; the gender the parents and the rest of society believe the child to be; the gender in which the child is reared
8.  Gender identity: The person's private, internal sense of maleness, femaleness, or non-binaryness

These variables might be subdivided into biological variables (1 to 6) and psychological variables (7 and 8). 

As a result of any one of a number of factors during the course of prenatal sexual development, the gender indicated by one or more of these variables may disagree with the gender indicated by others. When the contradictions are among several of the biological variables a person is referred to as intersex or pseudohermaphrodite.  Biologically, the gender of such a person is ambiguous; the reproductive structures may be partly male and partly female, or they may be incompletely male or female. Approximately 2 per cent of births have an intersex condition **\[10\]**. 

### Intersex {.unnumbered}

In most cases the biological factors are in agreement in an individual. For example, a person will have XX chromosomes, ovaries, a uterus, vagina, vulva and clitoris. That individual is identified as female, most likely raised as a girl, and think of herself as a woman. However, in approximately 2% of births the biological factors described above are not all in agreement. When there are contradictions the person is called **intersex**, and their biological sex is ambiguous (**\[1\]**. Among certain peoples, a number of syndromes cause certain reproductive structures to develop as both male and female in some people, and the most common are: **Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH), Progestin-induced pseudohermaphroditism, and Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS)**.

In congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH, also called "adrenogenital syndrome"), a genetic female develops ovaries normally as a fetus. Later in the course of prenatal development the adrenal gland begins to function abnormally as a result of a recessive genetic condition unconnected with the sex chromosomes, which causes an excess amount of androgens to be produced. Prenatal sexual differentiation then does not follow the normal female course. As a result, the external genitals are partly or completely male in appearance; the labia are partly or totally fused leaving no vaginal opening; and the clitoris is enlarged to the size of a small penis or even a full-sized one. Hence at birth these genetic females are sometimes identified as males. Long-term follow-ups indicate that CAH girls have a female gender identity and generally function well as girls and women. **\[1 p.121\]** 

Progestin-induced pseudohermaphroditism is a similar syndrome that resulted from a drug, progestin, which was at one time given to pregnant women to help them maintain the pregnancy if they were prone to miscarriage. As the drug circulated in the mother's blood-stream, the developing fetus was essentially exposed to a high dose of androgens. (Progestin and androgens are quite similar biochemically and progestin can easily convert to androgens.) In genetic females this produced an abnormal, masculinized genital development similar to that found in CAH. **\[1 p.121\]**

With androgen insensitivity syndrome a genetic male produces normal levels of testosterone; however, as a result of a genetic condition the body tissues are insensitive to the testosterone, and prenatal development is feminized. The individual is born with the external appearance of a female: a small vagina but no uterus and undescended testes. **\[1 p.121\]**

Intersex persons provide evidence for the complexity of sex and gender development. Many variables are involved in gender and sex, and there are many steps in gender differentiation, even before birth. Because the process is complex it is vulnerable to disturbances.

An intersex phenomenon was studied in a small community in the Dominican Republic (Imperato-McGinley et al., 1974). Due to a genetic-endocrine problem, a large number of genetic males were born there who, at birth, appeared to be females. The syndrome is called 5-Alpha Reductase Syndrome. They had a vaginal pouch instead of a scrotum and a clitoris-sized penis. According to the researchers, the uneducated parents were unaware that there were any problems, and these genetic males were treated as typical females. At puberty, a spontaneous biological change caused a penis to develop. Significantly, their gender identity also changed without concern, despite being reared as females, and they developed heterosexual interests. In their culture, these people are called Guevodoces ("penis at twelve"). **\[1 p.121 \]**

Anthropologist Gilbert Herdt (1990) is critical of the research and interpretations about the Guevodoces. The major criticism is that the Western researchers assumed that this culture is a two-gender society, as in Canada, and that people have to fall into one of only two categories, either male or female. Anthropologists, however, have documented the existence of three-gender societies, that is, societies in which there are three, not two, gender categories. The society in which the Guevodoces grow up is a three-gender society. The third gender is the Guevodoces. Their gender identity is not male or female, but Guevodoce. The 5-Alpha Reductase Syndrome has also been found among the Sambia of New Guinea, who also have a three-gender culture. The example of the Guevodoce demonstrates how cultural attitudes about sex may unwittingly be shaped by the peculiarities of human biology. **\[1 p.121 \]** 

### Sexual Differentiation During Puberty {.unnumbered}

Puberty is not a distinct point in time; rather it is the finalization of the sexual differentiation process. As noted in Unit C, puberty is the life-stage during which the body changes from that of a child into that of an adult, who demonstrates secondary sexual characteristics and the ability to reproduce sexually. Puberty can be scientifically defined as the time during which there is sudden enlargement and maturation of the gonads, other genitalia, and secondary sex characteristics (such as breasts or a beard), leading to reproductive capacity (Tanner, 1967).  Perhaps, the single most important event in the process is the first ejaculation for the male and the first menstruation for the female, although the latter is not necessarily a sign of reproductive capability sincefemales typically do not produce mature eggs until a year or two after the first menstruation. **\[1 p.121 \]** 

### What Mapping the Genome Taught Us {.unnumbered}

Blogger Rebecca Helm invites us to consider what is known about biological sex, since the mapping of the genome. She suggests that there are many variables of how the XX and XY chromosomes mix and match, and that it is possible that in some cases there may be a difference between biological sex and sexual characteristics identify a person as male or female. Her article gives food for thought on social habits of judging a book by its cover, when it comes to what is male, man, female, woman and so forth. [Geek Girls: Biologist Explains Biological Sex](http://geekxgirls.com/article.php?ID=12697&fbclid=IwAR27gLGjb0BZdxMdQlmFnG-lHYGUV13Idy-nTYHopK49UCh_wgN_hco0NQk#.XjQQtNKg9iA.facebook)  See PDF [Biologist Rebecca Helm Explains Biological Sex](https://justisse.ca/MediaGallery/HRHP%20Documents/HRHP/UnitB/biological%20sex%20R-Helm.pdf)

## 2.4 - Theories and Research {.unnumbered}

### Theories about Human Sexuality {.unnumbered}

Primary gender identity develops as the child matures to adulthood. Gender identity (See Unit B Section 2.3) continues to develop in complexity throughout adulthood; based on the foundations laid during childhood and young adulthood, as well as influences of a person's psycho-social milieu. Influences embedded in the development of gender identity include: 

-   The child's biological sex factors
-   Gender identity enacted by opposite gender persons to whom the child relates and is exposed
-   Gender identity enacted by same gendered persons to whom the child relates and is exposed
-   The response of family and close community towards the child's behaviour and gender expression
-   Religious restrictions, privileges, rituals, or beliefs the child experiences that are particular to his or her gender
-   Socio-political and cultural norms, and variations from the norm, the child experiences that are particular to his or her gender 

There is a natural, instinctual curiosity and drive for humans to explore sexual behavior. Throughout infancy and childhood, children become curious about their bodies, particularly their genitals and erogenous zones. During puberty, the body undergoes a number of changes - developing secondary sex characteristics (such as breasts in women) and the capacity for reproduction. Teens become more curious about sex and begin expressing their sexuality more overtly. They acquire most of their knowledge about sex and sexuality from their peers and media. They experiment more with acting out sexual desires - through masturbation and self-exploration, and exploration with others. Many explore same-gender sexual activity through fantasy and sexual experimentation. Over time their gender, their individual psyche, their socialization process, and their external environments delineate their sexual identity.

Commonly North American culture associates the male gender with things considered inherently “masculine,” such as hunting, building and mechanical skills, or athletics. The female gender is associated with things considered inherently “feminine,” such as caring for children, home-making, and a greater capacity for feeling and relationship. These associations influence how male and female children are raised with differing societal expectations according to their gender. There is no clear agreement within the scientific community regarding the development of gender and nature of differences between men and women. Below is a brief overview of several theories on the development of gender roles and sexual identity that make-up the perceived differences between the sexes.

**CAVEAT: Each of the theories below have a link for you to look at the idea a bit deeper. You are not responsible to know anything more than is on this page, but you may be curious, which is encouraged. Also the links are not meant to lead you to a comprehensive or absolute knowledge of the topic.**

### [Evolutionary Psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_psychology) {.unnumbered}

Evolutionary psychologists believe that biologically ingrained differences between men and women determine the enactment of gender roles, and through that the development of sexual identity. Among many assertions, the evolutionists claim that men have historically been the more aggressive of the sexes, and more willing to have sex with multiple partners. They argue that women prefer a stable environment for raising their families, and are by nature less aggressive than men . These differences, evolutionary theorists believe, develop into gender roles which facilitate the continuance of the human race.

### [Psychoanalytic Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalytic_theory) {.unnumbered}

Developed by [Sigmund Freud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud), this approach has not undergone a formal scientific evaluation of its validity. Freud believed that gender roles were defined by a number of interactions between children, their parents, and others around them. In his drive theory, Freud posited that two overarching drives rule the human psyche - libido (sexual) and aggression. He believed that these drives characteristically shape all ways of human being and living, and that they are the main influence on psycho-sexual and relational development.

### [Social Learning Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_learning_theory) {.unnumbered}

This widely proffered theory of [Albert Bandura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Bandura) claims that sexual identity develops from exposure to the enactment of gender roles as defined by the individual's cultural background. Primarily, it develops from individual interaction with parents, peers, and significant role models through a process of observation, imitation, and instruction.

### [Piaget's Cognitive-Developmental Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piaget%27s_theory_of_cognitive_development) {.unnumbered}

The Cognitive-Development theory is an expansion of the **Social Learning Theory**. Its proponents maintain that the individual's sense of his or her own gender is used to understand and interact with the social environment. In turn, gender identity continually develops in interaction with the social environment.

### [Gender Schema Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_schema_theory) {.unnumbered}

This theory, first introduced by [Sandra Bem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandra_Bem) in 1981, combines the Social Learning and Cognitive-Development Theories, but broadens their scope to include a more global and complex understanding of society.

### [Behavioral Genetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioural_genetics) {.unnumbered}

Behavioral Geneticists assert that it is the **combination** of genetic and environmental influences that shape behaviors, and that this includes behaviors associated with gender role development and thus sexual identity.

### [Multifactorial Web](https://www.smiletrain.org/sites/default/files/medical/medical-research-library/search/pdfs/vh062.pdf) {.unnumbered}

This theory applies to all of human genetic expression, and regarding sexuality asserts that male and female children are born with predetermined biological sexual characteristics that are molded during the socialization process.

#### Continuous Unfolding Process Model of Human Sexuality (Matus, 1988) {.unnumbered}

The theories presented above focus on the progression of sexual development only up to adulthood, with a focus limited to the development of sexual relations to manifest physiological sexual expression as a demonstration of sexual maturity.  However, they omit two essential elements that inform the development of human sexuality: 1) **Continuous** development throughout a life time and 2) **Individual complexity** of being human and being sexual

-   Adults continue to develop sexually in profound ways throughout their lives.
-   Sexual development is a process that is much greater than sexual relations or expression and the behaviors that get us there.

The Continuous Unfolding Process Model of Human Sexuality **\[1\]** posits that sexual development occurs through the interactive unfolding of our **sexual, creative, and sensual selves**, and that this development is integral to the development of the total individual. The figure below is a schematic for the model. In this model, sexuality encompasses our sensual, sexual, and creative selves - represented in the schematic by a circle. These three elements are continuously interacting and mutually influential - represented in the schematic by three large circulating arrows **\[1\]**.![[B2.4-unfolding-sexuality.png]][link to image](https://justisse.ca/MediaGallery/HRHP%20Images/HRHP/UnitB/Three%20Fold%20Sexuality.jpg)

Our **sensual self** encompasses all that we are that relates to physical matter - the total expression of our physical being. It includes for example, our aesthetic sense, our need for physical touch and movement, and our senses of touch, smell, sight, sound, and taste. Our **sensual self** facilitates our expression of both our sexual and creative selves, and gives us feedback about our sexual and creative expressions.

Our **sexual self** is all that we are that relates to our genital-reproductive expression and the ways we go about achieving that expression. It includes for example, sexual intercourse, pregnancy and childbirth, as well as grooming behaviors that attract the object of our sexual desire **\[1\]**. Our sexual self is an expression of our primary libidinal energy and interactively excites our creative self.

The expression of our **creative self** is the non-genital or secondary discharge of our libidinal energy. It is all that we are that relates to our passionate and imaginative rapport with matter. It is also related to the unique rather than collective expression of our self. Our creative self can be expressed subtly such as in the way one chooses the order of words or the color of table linens one buys. It can also be expressed obviously as in the way we build our dreams into realities, write a poem, or create a dinner party for twelve. Our creative self interactively excites our sexual self.

The unfolding process of developing human sexuality is the daily rhythmic dilation and contraction of how we relate to ourselves and our environment in relation to our sensual, sexual, and creative selves. Throughout our lives - from the earliest genetic encoding at conception to our last breath and release from this world's reality - this unfolding process belongs to our total reality - “complexly and continuously in the process of enfolding and unfolding, to become either implicit or explicit with respect to the material world" **\[2 p.50\]**.

The process of developing sexuality is not always intelligible or logical, but when tracked back over time it manifests a coherence that resonates through the individual's sexual, sensual, and creative self, and that is reflected in the whole of the individual. Principally, the development of sexuality from infancy to young adulthood prepares the ground of sexual identity for the further seeding and flowering of the individual's total sexuality throughout life. Human sexuality is not limited to the mating ritual, or what we do with our genitals. Rather, it is a reflection of the human passionate desire for communion, continuance, and creative expression where we bring forth our essential being.

### Research about Human Sexuality {.unnumbered}

 Despite a plethora of sex research over the past century or so, there is still much to learn about human sexuality as a discreet phenomenon and as a phenomenon that is informed by the evolution of human consciousness. [Sexology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexology) is the term that refers to the scientific study of human sexuality. Opinions and perspectives about human sexuality is a varied as are human cultures and traditions. Opinions and views about these issues are not always based on facts or universal truths, rather more commonly on misinformation, superstition, stereotypes, prejudices, or fear. The field of sexology attempts to discover accurate knowledge, systematically test theories, and challenge perspective, opinions and superstitions.  Sexology engages in a number of endeavors regarding human sexuality:

-   creating basic knowledge and understanding
-   enhancing knowledge in order to influence sexual behaviour
-   identifying risk factors that may affect health
-   develop models for sexual health education
-   develop public policy for sexual health

There are a number of types of sex research. Basically the methods vary as regards:

-   whether the research rely on people's self-reports of their sexual behaviour
-   whether the scientist observes the sexual behaviour directly
-   whether large numbers of people are studied (surveys)
-   whether a small number or just a single individual is studied (in laboratory studies, qualitative research, or case studies)
-   whether the studies are conducted in the laboratory or in the field
-   whether sexual behaviour is studied simply as it occurs naturally or whether some attempt is made to manipulate it experimentally

When reviewing the research it is important to learn more about the techniques and methods for conducting research -- the strengths and limitations of the methods used. This will help us evaluate the value of studies that are cited as evidence for various conclusions or recommendations and help us decide whether we can accept these conclusions. To complicate matters, the mass media frequently report poor-quality research as enthusiastically as that of high-quality research, so we should be critical in our evaluation of what the mass media outputs, and read and evaluate the research for ourselves whenever possible.  The former applies to all research of course. Pondering the following when evaluating research:

**Population:** who are the people being studied, are they representative of the region or country; are conclusions about one population reasonably or not extrapolated to another population, what information about the population is included, what is excluded, what biases might there be? what problematic inferences made?   
**Sample:** Is the sample a whole population or part of a population, how representative are they of the research topic?   
**Random sampling:** How random is the sampling of the population, how likely does the sampling allow for a diverse population?

**Probability sampling:** What is the probability that each member of the population is fairly represented?

**Problem of refusal or non-response:** How does the refusal of some to participate in a study influence the outcome based on the data collected from those who were willing to participate?

**Volunteer bias:** What might be the research bias when some people refuse to participate

**Demographics and history**: How inclusive and comprehensive are the demographics and history of participants?

**Distortion:** How might participants distort the truth of their experience, or the researchers the truth of their findings?

**Extraneous Factors:** What various extraneous factors might influence the research data and outcome?

**Ethical Issues:** What ethical issues might distort/influence the research data and outcome?

### [The Kinsey Report](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinsey_Institute) {.unnumbered}

The Kinsey Report is one of the best know research studies. [Alfred Kinsey,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Kinsey) collected data in the late 1930s and 1940s in the United States. Currently his data is now largely of historical interest, however Kinsey documented his methods with extraordinary care, so his research is a good example of how to approach sex research. 

**The Kinsey Report: The Sample  \[3 pp 58-59\]**

> Kinsey and his colleagues interviewed a total of 5,300 males, and their responses were reported in Sexual Behavior in the Human Male (1948); 5,940 females contributed to Sexual Behavior in the Human Female (1953). Although some African Americans were interviewed, there wasn't a big enough sample of them so only interviews with Caucasians were included in the publications. The interviews were conducted between 1938 and 1949 in the United States.
> 
> Initially, Kinsey was not much concerned with sampling issues. His goal was simply to collect sex histories from as wide a variety of people as possible. He began conducting interviews on his university campus and then moved on to large U.S. cities, such as Chicago. Kinsey later became more concerned with sampling issues and developed a technique called JOO-percent sampling. In this method he contacted a group, obtained its cooperation, and then got every one of its members to give a history. Once the cooperation of a group had been secured, peer pressure ensured that all members would participate. Unfortunately, although he was successful in getting a complete sample from such groups, the groups themselves were by no means chosen randomly. Thus, among the groups from which 100-percent samples were obtained were 2 sororities, 9 fraternities, and 13 professional groups.
> 
> In the 1953 volume on females, Kinsey said that he and his colleagues had deliberately chosen not to use probability sampling methods because of the problems of non-response. This is a legitimate point. But as a result, we have almost no information on how adequate the sample was. One might say that the sampling was haphazard but not random. For example, there were more respondents from Indiana than from any other state. Generally, the following kinds of people were over-represented in the sample: university students, young people, well: educated people, Protestants, people living in major cities, and people living in Indiana and the Northeast United States. Underrepresented groups included manual labourers, less well-educated people, older people, Roman Catholics, Jews, members of racial minorities, and people living in rural areas. . . .
> 
> Although scientists generally regard Kinsey's sampling methods with some dismay, his face-to-face interviewing techniques are highly regarded. More than 50 percent of the interviews were done by Kinsey himself and the rest by his associates, whom he trained carefully. . . .
> 
> How Accurate Were the Kinsey Statistics?  When all is said and done, how accurate were the statistics presented by Kinsey? The American Statistical Association appointed a blue-ribbon panel to evaluate the Kinsey reports (Cochran et al., 1953; for other evaluations see Terman, 1948; Wallin, 1949). While the panel members generally felt that the interview techniques had been excellent, they were dismayed by Kinsey's failure to use probability sampling and concluded, somewhat pessimistically:
> 
>  In the absence of a probability-sample bench-mark, the present results must be regarded as subject to systematic errors of unknown magnitude due to selective sampling (via volunteering and the like). (Cochran et al., 1953, p. 711) 
> 
> However, they also felt that this was a nearly insoluble problem for sex research; even if a probability sample were used, refusals would still create serious problems. The statisticians who evaluated Kinsey's methods felt that one aspect of his findings might have been particularly subject to error: the generally high levels of sexual activity, and particularly the high incidence of homosexual behaviour. These conclusions might, they felt, have been seriously influenced by sampling problems, particularly Kinsey's tendency to seek out persons with unusual sexual practices. Kinsey's associates felt that the most question-able statistic was the incidence of male homosexuality. Wardell Pomeroy commented, "The magic 37 percent of males who had one or more homosexual experiences was, no doubt, overestimated" (1972, p. 466). In sum, it is impossible to say how accurate the Kinsey statistics are; they may be very accurate or may contain serious errors. But Kinsey's work was a landmark development in sex research.

## Journal Activity - B2.4 Different Views about Sex {.unnumbered}

### Different Views about Sex: The McGarrys {.unnumbered}

Each member of the McGarry family views sex in a different way. Pat and Angela McGarry believe that religion is an important consideration when looking at sex. However, while the Catholic Church does not believe in birth control, Pat and Angela do encourage their offspring to use barrier methods during intercourse to prevent the spread of infectious disease. The couple does not approve of abortion or homosexuality - considering both to be against God's wishes. Their son Joseph, a priest, practices abstinence in order to deepen his relationship with God. Their son Michael, a lawyer, has many sexual partners. Their daughter and youngest child, Marci, has very limited sexual experience - primarily because she is afraid of her natural inclinations. How might the sexual values of the McGarry offspring have been influenced by their parents? Reflect and tell your journal all about it.

## 2.5 - Sexual Response {.unnumbered}

### Sexual Response {.unnumbered}

When individuals are sexually aroused, their bodies respond in several ways. Both women and men experience an increase in heart rate, respiration, muscle tension, and blood pressure, combined with possible flushing of the skin and nipple erection. There are also individual differences in how women and men respond to sexual arousal.

**Female Arousal** 

The vagina is lubricated by fluid secreted from the Bartholin's glands that lie beneath the tissue of the vaginal opening (introitus) . The clitoris and labia become engorged and highly sensitive due to increased vascular flow, and the clitoral glans retracts under its hood. During orgasm, the amount of Bartholin's gland secretions increases. Once orgasm is complete, the body returns to its pre-arousal state. Multiple orgasms over a short time period are common if arousal continues (Review Unit C for definitions of anatomical terms).

**Male Arousal**

The penis becomes erect due to increased vascular flow, the scrotum contracts pulling the testicles close into the body, and a lubricative pre-seminal fluid is released by the Cowper's gland and discharged through the urethra. Ejaculation of semen typically accompanies orgasm, which is followed by a period of time (typically lengthier than that which women experience) before orgasm can again be achieved.

Although many sex researchers believe that there are inherent differences between the male and female sexual response, others believe the physiological changes men and women experience during sexual arousal fit into a unifying model. Masters and Johnson developed the _Four Phase Model_, and Helen Singer Kaplan the _Three Phase Model_. According to the developers of these models, although individuals have unique ways of responding to sexual stimulation, all sexual experience has common elements. (Some “sexual identity” models also propose various aspects of sexual response).

### Sexual Response: The Four Phase Model & Three Phase Model {.unnumbered}

[Four Phase Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexual_response_cycle)

The Four Phase Model was developed in 1966 by Masters and Johnson. In this model there are four categorized phases experienced by the body during sexual interaction:

1.  **Excitement** - During sexual interaction, the body becomes sexually aroused and responds physiologically
2.  **Plateau** - Physiological changes accompanying arousal build to the plateau phase and level off - this stage can last for a few minutes or for several hours.
3.  **Orgasm --** The plateau phase may lead to orgasm, which lasts a relatively short time.
4.  **Resolution --** Following orgasm, the body relaxes and arousal diminishes (refractory phase). A subtle threshold of arousal may continue that allows for a quick return to orgasm, which allows for multiple orgasms, particularly in women.

[Three Phase Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexual_response_cycle)

Helen Singer Kaplan believed that the level of desire experienced by an individual before and during sexual activity had been overlooked by Masters and Johnson. In 1979, Kaplan developed a model incorporating three phases: **desire**, **vaso-congestion**, and **orgasmic release.** In this framework psychological desire leads to a vascular constriction that causes tissue engorgement, muscle tension, and eventually orgasm. Kaplan's model is more mechanical than Masters and Johnson's model, and does not include a refractory phase.

As research into the physiological and psychological aspects of human sexuality continues, so does the variety and number of theories for understanding this subject. As the modern axiom goes: _“Different strokes for different folks.”_ People respond differently to stimuli. Their response depends upon their social and/or cultural background, their experience with sex, and their relationship with their sexual partner. Moreover, hormones may play a role in sexual response. For example, testosterone, present in both men and women, acts as a sexual desire activator \[1\]. It is wise to address scientific inquiry into human sexuality critically and be aware that this exploration is in its infancy relative to how long human beings have been living and experiencing their sexuality. Most new scientific inquiries seek to improve or discredit the understanding of “truth” purported by the theories that precede them.

## 2.6 - Sexuality and the Life Cycle {.unnumbered}

Human sexuality unfolds from infancy to older adulthood. It is a journey and a process of discovery that changes throughout a person's lifespan, and is influenced by that person's genetic makeup, experience through puberty, sexual orientation and expression, ability to form relationships, experiences of violence, physical ability, etc., etc. There is tremendous variation in how human societies move through developmental and cultural milestones, and the meanings attached to them.

## Journal Activity - B2.6 Sexuality in My Lifespan {.unnumbered}

**Sexuality in My Lifespan**

Consider for your Journal, at this moment in your life, what are important factors in how you think of your sexual life continuum and relationships? Reflect on the process of growing up and becoming a sexual or asexual person. How is your sexuality different now than when you were younger? How do you project this will change as you age?
