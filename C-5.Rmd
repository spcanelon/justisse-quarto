# 5: Parameters of the Menstrual Cycle {.unnumbered}

## 5.1 - Introduction {.unnumbered}

There are various reasons why people seek counsel from an HRHP. Among these are a history of unfavourable experiences with certain forms of birth control; dissatisfying encounters with reproductive health care counsellors or providers; reproductive health problems; an interest in holistic approaches to reproductive health; failures with new reproductive technologies (NRT); and others. The common thread with most who seek counsel from an HRHP is **the desire to become more knowledgeable about their reproductive system and health, and to have more control over their reproductive health and reproductive choices through that knowledge**.

Knowledge about the reproductive system and reproductive health is accessible to many. In fact, there is a plethora of information available through the internet for those who have access. However, the quality and accuracy of the information available is generally suspect. The greatest misinformation is in the areas of birth control, infertility treatments, and hormone replacement therapies. Another concern is that few health care service providers have the time or take the time to help the uninitiated woman sort through this information glut, to find a meaningful and purposeful understanding of their reproductive system, health, and choices. Many learn from friends and relatives, who are often innocently ill informed and thus perpetuate misinformation. Others learn from health care practitioners whose education in reproductive health and education is largely determined by those who hold the purse strings that pay for the research and dissemination of information on these matters. Ambitious entrepreneurs and multinational corporations see the reproductive body as a commodity and exploit  peoples fears and concerns about reproductive health to make money, and often perpetuate misinformation or the withholding of information to maintain their mercantile goals. In truth, a person does not have reproductive freedom if they do not have a full and unbiased disclosure about their reproductive bodies and choices. It then becomes **the task of the HRHP to share with the client the knowledge that empowers them to make reproductive choices based on full and unbiased disclosure**.

**Part of facilitating a fully informed reproductive choice is to teach the client how to recognize, chart, and interpret the events of their menstrual cycle**. Unit C Section 5 examines the particular physiological events of the female reproductive cycle that they can be taught to recognize, chart, and interpret. With that knowledge they will better understand their reproductive cycle, as well as to use that information to avoid or achieve pregnancy, or to monitor their reproductive health. Sections 2 and 3 on part of male and female reproductive anatomy and physiology introduced some of the events. Section 5 breaks down into the following subsections.

-   5.2 Statistical Parameters of the Menstrual Cycle Menstrual Cycle
-   5.3 Events Indicating Fertility or Infertility
-   5.4 Atypical Menstrual Cycle Events
-   5.5 Return of Fertility Postpartum (Breastfeeding & Non-Breastfeeding)
-   5.6 “Coming off the Birth Control Pill”
-   5.7 Ovulation - Several Other Considerations
-   5.8 Climacteric & Menopause
-   5.9 Basic Infertile Pattern 

Much of the information in Section 5 dispels many female reproductive cycle myths and fills in lacunae on the subject, and thus moves the HRHP closer to having greater knowledge for providing broader disclosure for their clients to achieve a more fully informed consent.

## 5.2 - Statistical Parameters of the Menstrual Cycle {.unnumbered}

Under healthy conditions female reproductive physiology is a phenomenally balanced cyclic system recurring approximately every 28 days in preparation for conception and gestation. Commonly this cyclic system is called the Menstrual Cycle (MC) though correctly it is the Female Reproductive Cycle (FRC).

Studies on the length of the menstrual cycle is noted as early as 1858 with the work of J.A Clos:

Menstruate and ovulate may not always be regular; intervals between these events may be shorter or longer. For example, in the early years following menarche and during the premenopause there can be a significant variation in ovulation and menstruation regularity. Similarity after childbirth and after discontinuing hormonal contraceptives, during illness, under conditions of malnourishment, and during times of exceptional physical and  emotional stress, irregularity of the FRC cyclicity may occur. This was understood in the earliest decades of Western Medicine:

> "A woman does not always menstruate regularly; every so often, the intervals are shorter or longer. After the menarche, as well as in the premenopausal age, there are great irregularities, as there are after childbirth. In addition such irregularities are produced by diseases, indisposition, malnourishment, and passions." (J. A. Close 1858 quoted in Signs of Fertility: The Personal Science of Natural Birth Control. 2nd Ed. Margaret Nofziger. Deatsville, AL. MND Pub. p. 15.)

Others such as Stein and Cohen (1936) concluded that "the menstrual cycle is regularly irregular" \[1\]. Frequently cited data on the normal menstrual cycle statistics come from the work of both **A.A. Treolar**\[2\], and the **Tremin Trust** \[3\], which from 1935 to 1962 gathered data on cycle length and cyclicity from 2700 women totalling over 27,000 person years and over a quarter million cycles\[4\]. Since that research, it has become established as fact that the menstrual cycle has certain parameters of irregularity that are considered normal or physiologically healthy. Outside of those parameters we start to see pathology of the FRC.

There are many studies that will disagree with each other but essentially the ranges of normal and parameters of normal tend to fall fairly close to each other statistically. This is not surprising as one must account for the variability of factors from one population of subject to another, factors such as nutritional status, exposure to CEDs, lifestyle, medical history, culture, and era.

### Required Reading {.unnumbered}

[Variability in the Phases of the Menstrual Cycle](http://epublications.marquette.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1010&context=nursing_fac) Fehring, Schneider, Raviele (2006) provides a more modern view of cycle variations.

The following is not a required reading, but may appeal to those who love tables of statistics and want to see the variety of cycle parameters. [Real-world menstrual cycle characteristics of more than 600,00 menstrual cycles](https://justisse.ca/MediaGallery/HRHP%20Documents/HRHP/UnitC/Menstrual%20Cycle%20Parameters%20600K%20cycles.pdf) (2019). Please note that this study is based on observations from the app Natural Cycles, and so includes numbers based on whichever shortcomings the app has, and the mistakes the app users made.

**NOTE:** The following two tables demonstrate some of the research findings as regards menstrual cycle length. Please note there is controversy about the validity of the methodology of these findings, yet they remain standard text for those in the field of reproductive health. 

**Statistics do not equal reality, and thus we must always leave room to consider biochemical individuality and individual circumstance and how all that unfolds according to the finesse of epigenetics -- internal and external environmental** **influences** **and individual response to such influences. We must apply science in balance with common sense.**

> **Abstract:** A group of over 2700 women have been studied for a period of 37 years to determine variations in the menstrual cycle. Over the course of the study various subgroups have been added. Computers were used to analyze the data. Earliest menarche recorded was age 9, the latest age 19. (Those who were anovulatory were excluded from study.) Natural menopause has been recorded in 324 cases: the earliest age, 37, and the latest 56. Average age is between 49-50. Menstrual periods are extremely irregular during the 7 years immediately after menarche, which usually begins about age 13, and during the years after 40. During the midyears, defined at 20-40, the only regular observation is that menstrual cycles are extremely irregular. A woman rarely has the same interval between periods more than 5 consecutive times, and cycle length varies from 35 days to 23 or 24 days. During the middle years the cycle length generally decreases from aobut 35-31 years during the early 20s to about 28 days around the late 20s, and even less around 30. Perfect regularity in menstrual rhythm is a myth, regularity within 3-4 days is rare, irregularity is normal.

### **Six Factors Demonstrate Female Reproductive Cycle (FRC) Processes**  

Six factors demonstrate physiological processes of the FRC. Individually, each factor contributes to overall cycle normalcy, variability or stability. These six factors are:

1.  overall cycle length
2.  number of days of menstruation
3.  number of days following menstruation before the onset of cervical mucus accompanying ovulation
4.  following #3 above, the number of days cervical mucus is present and accompanies ovulation
5.  ovulation day
6.  the number of days after ovulation before menstruation begins.

The combined length of the later five factors determines the length of the first factor. Each factor has a corresponding hormonal backdrop (as discussed in Unit C 2.4), the outcome of which determines the final character of each factor or menstrual cycle parameter. The charter learns to accurately observe, chart, and interpret these factors, along with several other events that indicate fertility or infertility, as a way to develop an understanding of the cyclic changes of their unique FRC's expression of fertility.

Regarding what is generally considered a normal range does not necessarily mean the healthiest or most physiological ideal. For example, ideally in a healthy cycle ovulation occurs on PK-Day, though a variation of -2 <= PK => +3 is considered a normal range. Similarly, an ideal luteal phase is 13 to 14 days, but 12 to 16 days is considered a normal range.

### Cycle Length Variations {.unnumbered}

A woman's reproductive system is cyclical in nature. “Menstrual cycle” is a collective term used in reference to the female reproductive cycle (FRC). Strictly speaking, however, menstrual cycle refers specifically to the cyclical events of the endometrium. Because the menstrual bleeding that occurs as part of the menstrual cycle is such an obvious indication of the activity of the FRC, it is generally accepted that this event be used to delineate the start and finish of the female reproductive cycle.\[1\] Other “cycle events” are more or less subtle compared to menstruation, and have variations in their expression. They correspond with menstrual cycle events in particular ways. See image “Cycle Length Variations” below.

![[C5.2-1-cycle-length-variations.png]][Cycle Length Variations](https://justisse.ca/MediaGallery/HRHP%20Images/HRHP/UnitC/JM%20cycle%20length%20variations%20copy.jpg)

 The length of one menstrual cycle is equal to the interval from the first day of menstruation to the day before the onset of the next menstruation. Cycle length is variable. 

-   Regular cycles have a normal variation in length of 8 to 10 days. A cycle that varies from the 8 to 10 day variation, and which accompanies a period of stress (e.g. travel, illness, crisis, etc) is considered a normal deviation. 
-   Irregular cycles are cycles that vary in length greater than 10 days and that this variation is persistent over the period of 12 to 16 cycles. The first day of the menstrual cycle is the 1st day of menstrual flow. Subsequent cycle days are numbered 2, 3, 4, 5 . . . up to but not including the first day of the next menstrual period. 
-   The last day of the menstrual cycle is the day before the 1st day of the next menstrual flow.
-   A short cycle is a cycle that is 25 days or less in duration; a long cycle is one that is 35 days or longer. Few will have completely regular menstrual cycles, and a variation of up to 8 to 10 days is perfectly normal.

### Cycle Length Variations Following Menarche {.unnumbered}

Menstrual cycle length is normally variable for the first 2 to 5 years following **menarche** (onset of the first menstruation). Cycles tend to be be about 30 days in length with a range of 23.6 to 36.6 days, though more recently there is little available data as so many young females are prescribed hormonal contraceptives before their cycles reach full maturity.  It is normal for a newly menstruating female to “miss a “period” for several months, or be anovulatory for several months and still experience regular bleeding that is mistaken for a true menstruation.

**Menarche begins when the adolescent female acquires a ratio of body fat to weight and height (BFR) of 17 %.** **Twenty-two percent (22%) BFR is needed to maintain regular cycling and regular ovulation.** A female who is engaged in athletics, is very active, diets regularly, or lives with undue stress or trauma is most likely to have a BFR below the ideal and thus will have irregular cycles. Regardless of BFR, the FRC still takes several years to fully mature and regulate.

### Cycle Length from mid 20s to Menopause {.unnumbered}

In reproductively healthy females, cycle length tends to be most **stable from ages 25 to 35 or 40**. The average cycle **normal length is 28 days**, and the **normal range is 27 to 35 days**.

**_NOTE; Any female that has used contraceptive endocrine disruptors (hormonal birth control) cannot be correctly included in studies that define female reproductive health._** 

At the onset of the **climacteric**, starting between the ages of ages 35 to 40, cycle length begins to vary. Cycle length variation in the climacteric follows one of three patterns:

-   Cycles remain regular and then stop suddenly (menopause)
-   Cycles vary widely in length between short and long before menopause
-   Cycles shorten for a few years and then get progressively longer before menopause.

The third pattern is the most common. The movement into greater variation in cycle length during the climacteric is due to the winding down process of the reproductive hormonal system that ultimately leads to menopause. (See Unit C2 Section 3.3 “Climactic (Perimenopause) & Menopause”)

\[1\] Menstrual cycle referring to the FRC -- This model is in part historic. The last two centuries has seen numerous new understandings about the FRC, including indicators of fertility other than menstruation, before which menstruation was the best, if not the only, marker of women's cyclic reproductive nature. There are no historical records of the use of the other indicators of fertility to determine the cyclic nature of the FRC, though this may not mean charters were not aware of other indicators, or that the record of their reproductive concerns have been correctly interpreted or translated. Considering that most were essentially illiterate before the 18th century, and that very little 'wise woman' knowledge is extant, we cannot precisely say what was or was not know about the menstrual cycles, by the individual or the collective.

### Menstruation (Menses)  {.unnumbered}

#### Normal (Healthy) Menstruation - Volume - Duration {.unnumbered}

**Healthy Menstruation (menstrum) lasts from 3 to 6 days, on average 5 days.** **Normal flow volume is 30 ml to 80 ml.** Menstrum consists of blood, serous fluid from the secretory endometrium, endometrial tissue, cervical mucus, and vaginal secretions. Its odor is musky and metallic, and is not foul smelling when fresh. Heavy to moderate flow is wet and slippery feeling and is a deep burgundy-red in color - slightly darker than venous blood. Light to very light flow is moist and smooth feeling and is a bright red, to pink, or brownish in color. (see Appendix A)

Healthy menstrual flow has a **crescendo-decrescendo** pattern - it starts heavy or moderate and decreases to light and then very light. The viscosity of menstrum is serous and varies slightly but is generally quite fluid with a mucus-like quality.

**_It is important to note that the research_** _that estimates average menstrual flow does not differentiate between true menstruations and bleeds associated with hormonal contraceptive and IUD use, nor does it differentiate or categorize participants into different reproductive health categories, or account for endocrine health (MHRG 2011. Harlow 1995).  The reporting of menstrual flow as heavy or light is highly subjective (Hallberg, et.al 1964; Cemcor). In the research the estimated volume for menstrual flow ranges from the lowest volume from between 10 to 35 ml and the highest volume from between of 45 to 80 ml._

_Those whose flow volume or pattern does not fit into the parameters outline above, should be advised to have a health care provider who is skilled in the assessment of menstrual cycle parameters to assess their hormonal and immune status, health history, birth control history, and other factors related to diet and lifestyle._

_Bleeding that is **NOT true menstrual bleeding** is called atypical, unusual bleeding or breakthrough bleeding. The bleeding that is experienced while taking CED is not true menstruation!!!  The IUD (copper and hormonal) may alter normal menstrum patterns, typically inducing a heavier flow with the copper IUD and continuous bleeding/spotting with the hormonal IUD._

In general, most charters are confident in differentiating between normal menstrual bleeding and atypical bleeding, if they have had experience of some healthy menstrual cycles.

#### Charting and Measuring Menstrual Flow - What is Normal for Her? {.unnumbered}

**1 tsp = 5ml, 1 tablespoon = 14 ml, 6 tsp equals 1 ounce, 1 ounce = 30 ml**

**10 ml = 2 tsp, 35 ml = 7 tsp (2.5 TBS), 45 ml = 9 tsp (3.2 TBS), 80 ml = 16 tsp (5.8 TBS)**

Menstrual flow is charted on using the designations H, M, L, VL, and observations for cervical mucus are made on L and VL days. Commonly the charter may not recognize or know what true menstrual flow is, and thus, importantly, not recognize anovulatory bleeding or other problematic bleeding patterns.

To determine the volume of menstrum keep track of _**how many pads**_ and/_or_ _**tampons**_ that are **“soaked”** _or **how many times the Diva cup (or such) is filled**_**.**  How many on Heavy flow days? How many on Medium flow days? How many on L and VL flow days? Is the flow just “spotting” or is the pad or tampon soaked pad every hour? Are there clots in the flow? What is the color of the flow? Candy apple red, port wine red, pinkish, or black or brown? **It is important that the charter discover what is normal their normal her, and then with the help of their health care provider rule out any pathology.**

**Flow Volume guide:** a normal H day would be about 4 to 5 pads, a normal M would be about 3 to 4 pads, and so on. A [Diva Cup](http://divacup.com/) holds about 30ml of menstrum. In many ways this assessment is subjective, but it is important to determine whether or not the flow volume falls within the normal range.

**_Normal Flow_** **is 30 ml to 80 ml of flow from over 3 to 7 days**

**_Menorrhagia_** **(hypermenorrhea_)_** _is over 200 ml of flow_

**_Heavy Flow_** is over 80 ml of flow

**_Very Light Menstruation_** _is less than 30 ml of flow over 3 days or less_

#### Menstruation along the Reproductive Cycle Continuum {.unnumbered}

**Menarche** (first menstruation) occurs on average at age 13, with a range of between the 10 to 16 years of age. During the first 2 to 5 years following menarche, characteristics of the menstrum may vary widely. In part, this is because not every bleed is preceded by an ovulatory event, and thus a young female may experience both true menstruation and withdrawal bleeding events until the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis (HPOA) establishes cycle regularity. Post-menarche menstruation patterns from cycle to cycle may be similar pattern to that of the perimenopause during which the HPOA is shutting down cyclicity.

With the onset of the **climacteric**, menstrual flow begins to change in volume, duration, and character. Menses may initially be very heavy at start of perimenopause, and become lighter towards menopause due to anovulatory events and/or hormonal imbalances. The variable pattern of menstrual flow and cyclicity is not unlike the variation in the early years following menarche. For example both perimenopausal and post-menarche females may experience any of the following patterns of menstrual flow:

-   heavy flow with clots
-   intermittent flow
-   surges (stop-start) of flow
-   several days of spotting before or after the main flow
-   very light flow

Perimenopausal females are more subject to **pathological atypical uterine bleeding patterns** than post-menarche females.

### Days Before the Onset of Cervical mucus Accompanying Ovulation {.unnumbered}

The number of days counted from the last day of menstrual flow to the first day of cervical mucus represents the “**days before the onset of cervical mucus**.” This phase of the female reproductive cycle is on average **6 days** in length, and normally ranges from **0 to 15 days**.

These days are **dry (0)** that is there is **NO cervical mucus** present at the vulva. A small percentage of females may experience a **continuous basic- infertile pattern** of non-peak discharge. This is discharge that is **NOT clear (K), stretchy (10), or lubricative/slippery (L)**, and is generally sticky-pasty-cloudy (6PC), sticky-pasty-yellow (6PY), or sticky-cloudy (6C). The source of this non-peak discharge is vaginal epithelial cell slough. (Subsequent units explain how to manage the understanding of the basic infertile pattern.)

**This phase ends when** there is the experience of 1 day of peak-type cervical mucus, or 3 or more days of non-peak discharge (that are not part of a basic-infertile pattern). This phase continues of there is an experience of 1 or 2 days of non-peak discharge (that are not part of a basic-infertile pattern) and then returns to dry days, without any other events occurring that accompany ovulation (e.g. Mittelschmerz, BBT rise, cervix is high, soft and open). The days of non-peak discharge are themselves considered fertile.

Those who experience the “cervical mucus accompanying ovulation” event at the extreme end of its normal onset (e.g. 15 days after menses) are more likely to experience **multiple non-peak discharge events**.

Sometimes the **number of “days before the onset of cervical mucus accompanying ovulation” is zero or less**. Some women, especially those in the climacteric, may experience the onset of “cervical mucus accompanying ovulation” the day after menstruation ends or during the light and very light days of menses. It is then important fto check for signs of cervical mucus during the light and very light days of menses, especially after day five of the cycle. Under such circumstances, **conception can conceive during menses** if the cervical mucus event accompanies ovulation.

**A JUSTISSE USER'S CHARTING NOTE:** 

Check for cervical mucus on the light and very light days of menses the same way they check for cervical mucus any other day. Menstruation is considered fertile when first beginning to chart menstrual cycles for two reasons: 1) an intermenstrual bleeding may be mistaken for a menstrual bleed, and often intermenstrual bleeding accompanies ovulation or ovulation within a few days or 2) an ovulatory bleed may be mistaken for a menstrual bleed. Once the charter is confidence to identify any bleeding as normal menstruation or as unusual bleeding, they can then consider heavy and moderate days of menstruation as infertile, and observe for the presence or absence of cervical mucus on light and very light days. Always, if in doubt about the presence or absence of cervical mucus, and especially when avoiding pregnancy or achieving pregnancy, it is best to err on the side of considering the day fertile and act accordingly. IF IN DOUBT CONSIDER YOURSELF FERTILE!! 

In general, the “days before the onset of cervical mucus accompanying ovulation” correspond with:

-   The **early proliferative phase** of the ovarian cycle, influenced by estrogen secreted by developing follicles
-   The **development of the primordial follicle** into a primary follicle

The “days before the onset of cervical mucus accompanying ovulation” are infertile, as without the presence of cervical mucus sperm cannot survive. 

___

### Presence of cervical mucus accompanying ovulation {.unnumbered}

Normally, cervical mucus accompanying ovulation is present at the vulva for **4 days** on average, and ranges from **3 to 7 days**. Days during which cervical mucus is present, plus a “count of 3” days following are fertile days, because sperm survive and are capacitated in cervical mucus. There are three basic patterns to the presence of cervical mucus accompanying ovulation: 

-   Begins with **a subtle change** such as from dry to smooth or into one or several days of **non-peak cervical mucus** \-- sticky-pasty-cloudy (6PC), or tacky-cloudy (8C) cervical mucus - that develops into one or several days of **peak-type cervical mucus --** either stretchy (10), clear (K), cloudy-clear (C/K), or lubricous/slippery (L) - it then dries up for a “count of 3” and is followed by a typical postovulatory phase
-   Begins with a **readily identifiable (obvious) change from the dry or basic-infertile pattern** into non-peak type cervical mucus and then peak-type cervical mucus that dries up within the “count of 3”
-    Begins with a **readily identifiable (obvious) change from the dry or basic-infertile pattern** into peak-type cervical mucus that dries up within the “count of 3” 

In general, the days during the “presence of cervical mucus accompanying ovulation” correspond with:

-   The **later part of the proliferative phase** of the menstrual cycle
-   The **development of the vesicular follicle** into a secondary follicle during the ovarian cycle 

___

### Preovulatory Phase {.unnumbered}

The variable part of the female reproductive cycle consists of the days after menstruation before which ovulation occurs (**preovulatory phase**). The preovulatory phase includes the days before the onset of cervical mucus accompanying ovulation and the days of the presence of cervical mucus accompanying ovulation. The unique pattern of an individual woman's FRC and other influences that may hasten or delay ovulation determine its variability. Most variability occurs during the preovulatory phase. The observations and charting of the various indicators of fertility and infertility enables tracking the proximity of ovulation in the preovulatory phase.

TO REVIEW: Pre-Ovulatory Phase {.unnumbered}

The “days before the onset of cervical mucus accompanying ovulation” and “the presence of cervical mucus accompanying ovulation” make up the **pre-ovulatory** **phase** of the FRC.

The hormones FSH and estrogen regulate the pre-ovulatory phase. The pituitary gland secretes FSH, which stimulates follicular development in the ovary. The developing follicles produce increasing amounts of estrogen. As the estrogen levels rise:

-   Ovulation becomes imminent
-   The endometrium proliferates
-   The cervix rises, softens, and opens
-   Cervical crypts produce E-Type cervical mucus
-   BBT remains at or below “baseline”   

___

### Ovulation {.unnumbered}

After ovulation, the oocyte survives 12 to 24 hours; more recent studies indicate that it is more likely 12 than 24. Ovulation of any subsequent oocytes must occur within the same 12 to 24 hours of the first, after which further ovulations are impossible. One means of identifying ovulation is to identify “Peak Day.” **Peak day** is the last day of peak-type cervical mucus, followed by a “Count-of-3 Days” during which there are no cervical mucus symptoms present at the vulva. Peak-type cervical mucus is any cervical mucus that is clear, stretchy, or lubricative.

Studies using ultrasound to determine ovulation correlates Peak-Day with ovulation 33.3% to 36.2% percent of the time. The same studies indicate that ovulation occurs 74.5% to 75.7% of the time from Peak-Day plus or minus one day (-1 <= PK => +1); and 90.9% to 91.4% of the time from Peak-Day plus or minus two days (-2 <= PK => +2); and 8.5% to 9.1% of the time on Peak-Day plus 3 (PK => +3).

There are other studies that measure urinary LH and serum Progesterone to mark ovulation, but these markers are not as reliable as ultrasound as there is a wider variance in hormone levels among females (Fehring, 2002.). Ultrasound, observing the ovum leave the follicle, is a precise indicator of ovulation.

**Ovulation occurs ideally 13 to 14 days before menstruation**, ranging 12 to 16 days and corresponds to Peak. Bear in mind that “average” is a statistical term not a physiological fact.

#### TO REVIEW: Ovulation {.unnumbered}

When estrogen reaches a peak or critical level, the pituitary gland releases a **LH surge**, which triggers ovulation within 12 to 36 hours of that surge. **Ovulation** occurs when the swelling ovary wall ruptures and releases the **secondary oocyte** (dominant follicle or Graafian follicle) into the peritoneal cavity. 

#### Postovulatory Phase/Luteal Phase {.unnumbered}

The post-ovulatory phase is the interval between ovulation and the next menstruation. This phase remains more or less stable from cycle to cycle for those of normal fertility, who is not early post-menarche or perimenopausal. The number of days from Peak day until the onset of the next menstruation corresponds with the post-ovulatory phase, averaging 13 to 14  days in length, and ranging from 12 to 16 days. The post-ovulatory phase also corresponds to the life span of the corpus luteum, which begins to degenerate about 8 days after ovulation and completes this process, on average, about 13 to 14 days after ovulation.

“Peak day plus a count of 3” and/or a BBT Shift are charting **confirmations of ovulation**, and the post-ovulatory phase. The post-ovulatory phase is infertile and is characterized by dry days (occasionally a basic-infertile pattern of non-peak discharge), that is the absence of cervical mucus at the vulva. 

#### TO REVIEW: Post-Ovulatory Phase {.unnumbered}

The days following ovulation until the onset of the next menstruation make up the **post-ovulatory phase** of the FRC. Primarily, progesterone regulates the post-ovulatory phase.

-   After ovulation, the ruptured follicle develops into a corpus luteum under the influence of LH.
-   The corpus luteum produces progesterone. 
-   As progesterone levels rise:
-   Further ovulation is prevented 
-   The endometrium becomes secretory, preparing it for implantation
-   The cervix lowers, becomes firmed, closes
-   Cervical crypts produce a G-Type cervical mucus plug
-   BBT shifts above “baseline” and remains high until menstruation
-   Preventing sperm penetration
-   The corpus luteum survives about 13 to 14 days, unless implantation occurs

## 5.3 - Events Indicating Fertility or Infertility {.unnumbered}

Those who monitors their menstrual cycle events to determine states of fertility and infertility are practicing fertility awareness. **Fertility awareness** is the generic term that describes a life skill acquired by becoming intimately familiar with one's unique cycle of ovulation and menstruation. Fertility awareness may be used to to prevent or achieve pregnancy and/or to monitor gynecological and general health. The **Justisse Method** is one of several methods of fertility awareness. Variously, each method teaches a female person to observe, chart, and interpret scientifically proven fertility signs associated with the female reproductive cycle.

The **Justisse Method** teaches fertility awareness through the Justisse **Body Literacy** approach, which incorporates the collective understanding of fertility awareness with a unique perspective on reproductive health and reproductive choice.

### Body Literacy**\[1\]** {.unnumbered}

-   Provides skills needed to use the **Justisse Method** for natural birth control
-   Provides skills needed to use the **Justisse Method** to achieve pregnancy
-   Does not assume a that interest in observing, charting, and interpreting the menstrual cycle events is to achieve or avoid pregnancy.
-   Is the self-knowledge gained by learning to observe and chart scientifically proven signs of fertility and infertility, together with other health and wellness observations
-   Provides a broad knowledge base from which to make fully informed reproductive choices
-   Respects reproductive choice without question
-   Helps with tailoring reproductive choices for individual needs
-   Provides full disclosure about contraceptive methods, natural birth control, and holistic approaches for  those wanting direction in choosing remedies for or in understanding infertility, abortion, menarche and the early reproductive years, and perimenopause and menopause
-   Does not use any methodology in any way related to the obsolete, ineffective and disregarded Rhythm Method of natural birth control, though does respect the foundations of that method and its historical role in reproductive choice and management. 

The table below outlines the standard fertility awareness female reproductive system events, which one can easily observe, chart, and interpret for their own purposes. These events include the **three principle cycle events** (cervical mucus, BBT shift, cephalad shift) and **other useful cycle events** such as mittelschmerz or mood changes that reliably map the processes of the female reproductive system.

When the cervical plug is in place the charter experiences the dry days of the cycle.</p><p><strong>During the proliferative phase</strong>, as estrogen levels rise secretions of the estrogenic E-Type cervical mucus increases. The charter easily notice a sensation of smoothness or lubrication at the vulva when wiping, and notice the presence of mucus that is thin, lubricious, and/or translucent or transparent. Peak production of E-Type mucus occurs just before ovulation, and turns to G-Type mucus (dries up) quickly after ovulation. Its structure facilitates sperm transport and capacitation. In the presence of E-Type, mucus sperm survive from 2 to 6 days. Without E-Type, mucus sperm survive a few minutes. There are various names that refer to E-Type mucus: spinnbarkheit, peak mucus, peak type mucus, fertile mucus, fertile fluid, peak fluid, and wet, among others.&nbsp;</p><p>Sometimes <strong>vaginal cell slough</strong> mixes with E-Type cervical mucus, which gives the E-Type mucus a cloudy appearance and reduces its stretchiness. Vaginal cell slough is the vaginal epithelial cells that slough off and become vaginal discharge, a healthy process that ensures nourishment for friendly bacteria and for cleansing the vaginal canal. The vagina in certain circumstances (breastfeeding, perimenopause, breastfeeding, and coming off the birth control pill) will respond to some extent to rising estrogen levels by increasing its production and breakdown of vaginal epithelium.</p><p><strong>During the secretory phase,</strong> high levels of progesterone stop the production of E-type mucus. The mucus becomes a thick, gelatinous plug of G-Type cervical mucus. During the secretory phase, there should be no cervical mucus at the vulva, and instead there should be a sensation of dryness (dry days of the cycle). The G-Type mucus loses water content, which accounts for its greater viscosity compared to E-Type mucus.</p><p>The most important function of the cervical mucus is its role as <strong>Nature's Gate</strong>. When the gate is open, E-Type mucus predominates, and sperm can penetrate the cervix, await ovulation, and make the journey to the fallopian tubes where fertilization is attempted. When G-Type mucus predominates the gate is closed, and the cervical plug acts as a mechanical barrier, preventing sperm and other undesirable organisms from entering the uterine cavity, and thus the peritoneal cavity. The key for understanding the current state of fertility is understanding when the gate is closed and when it is open, which is why the detection and observation of cervical mucus is critical in determining fertility.</p><h4>Checking for Cervical mucus</h4><p>Cervical mucus changes are observed at the vulva (vaginal entrance) and are recorded at the end of each day. The Justisse Method requires using a flatly folded tissue to wipe across the vaginal opening (introitus) and perineum to detect mucus. Mucus changes appear at the cervix a few minutes or hours before they appearance at the vulva. The more fluid the cervical mucus is, that is to say the more the content of the discharge is E-Type mucus, which is a hydro gel, the more quickly the mucus will descend down the vaginal canal.</p><p>It is <strong>not recommended to use the fingers to check for cervical mucus</strong>&nbsp;for two reasons. One, that practice is not the technique supported by the scientific underpinnings on which the Justisse Method effectiveness is based, and two, that practice tends to create greater confusion about the presence or absence of cervical mucus, and often the 'overreading' of mucus. However, there are times when an HRHP might recommend testing with the fingers, but that would be a discretionary approach and the client would need to be warned that they are now using a less effective approach. Please discuss this with your HRHP Trainer.</p><p>Those who <strong>checks the cervix for changes</strong>&nbsp;may make note of any mucus found; though that notation is made separately in the "notes" section of the JM charting App or misc. box of the JM chart.&nbsp;</p><p>Developing awareness of cervical mucus changes takes time and perseverance. Usually after charting three to six cycles a fair degree of confidence and competence can be achieved. If the cycles are not healthy, such as when after coming off hormonal contraceptives, then it may take longer to develop confidence and competence, though that can be remedied by increasing the number of interactions with the HRHP.</p><p>"Infertile" days are those that are are DRY - NO mucus--sensation of dryness</p><p>"Fertile" dayrs are those when there is MUCUS or a SENSATION OF LUBRICATION present (E-Type/Peak or&nbsp;non-E-type/non-Peak, or sensation of slipperiness/lubrication)</p><p>Cervical mucus changes may be masked by seminal fluid, spermicide, or the discharge from vaginal infections. It is vital that the charter receives adequate teaching and support to monitor their cervical mucus events.</p><h4>Semen Elimination Technique (SET)</h4><p>In the early cycles of charting, it is common to confuse semen discharging from the vagina with cervical mucus. Semen differs from cervical mucus, in that it is more rubbery like rubber cement, whitish-yellow to whitish-grey in color, breaks easily if it stretches, and smells musky or fishy. Eliminating semen after intercourse can reduce confusion. (Even for those trying to achieve pregnancy, the sperm that survive will be safely in the cervical crypts within 20 minutes following intercourse.) The semen elimination technique (SET) is helpful in clearly identifying the presence or absence of cervical mucus, as well as in maintaining sexual hygiene. SET - 1) Urinate after intercourse within a comfortable amount of time (approx. 1 hour). 2) While urinating stop urine flow several times and wipe the vulva, front to back, after each stop of urine flow.</p><p>The rationale behind “alternate evening rule” for intercourse on dry days before ovulation when avoiding pregnancy is to ensure that the charter do not confuse semen discharged from the vagina with cervical mucus. Usually, this rule is applied until thecharter gains confidence in identifying the difference between semen discharge and E-type cervical mucus.</p><p>There are certain physiological conditions under which the cervix will be more or less responsive to hormonal stimulation, and thus alter the production of cervical mucus. For example, perimenopause, coming off the birth control pill, endocrine imbalances, cervical dysplasia, and others discussed in detail elsewhere.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Basal Body Temperature (BBT)</strong></p><p><strong>BBT Baseline</strong></p><p><strong>BBT Shift</strong></p><p><strong>Changes in Sensation of Body Heat</strong></p><p><strong>Ovulatory BBT Dip</strong></p></td><td><p>IN HEALTHY CYCLES After ovulation, progesterone levels rise sharply within 24 hours. Progesterone increases the basal metabolic rate (thermogenic effect) and thus the basal body temperature, causing a basal body temperature shift from a lower preovulatory level to a higher postovulatory level. The BBT shift is an upward rise in temperature by 0.15°C to 0.45°C (0.2°F to .9°F), and occurs within 24 hours after ovulation. <span>It is possible for ovulation to occur without a BBT shift in cycles where progesterone support is not adequate to have enough of a thermogenic effect to raise the BBT.</span></p><p>When the charter daily plots the waking BBT on a graph from the end of menstruation or Day 6 of the cycle, whichever occurs first, through to the onset of the next menstruation, at some point, they will readily notice a shift in the temperature from a sustained low level to a sustained high level. This BBT shift event indicates that ovulation has occurred. The shift is demonstrated by drawing a “baseline” or “cover-line” (see “Three ways to identify the BBT Shift” below). Some experience the BBT Shift as a change in the sensation of body heat to that of greater warmth, and when the BBT drops at onset of menses a change to that of greater coolness.</p><p>Generally, the BBT shift corresponds with Peak Day, or Peak Day plus 1. By the 3<sup>rd</sup>&nbsp;high BBT following the BBT Shift, most will notice that the cervical mucus has dried or is drying up. The BBT Shift has about a 90% correspondence with ovulation.<sup>[4,5]&nbsp;</sup></p><p>Because a BBT Shift indicates an ovulatory event, it is thus useful to verify a bleeding episode as either menstrual or inter-menstrual, and to verify a pregnancy as the BBT will remain high past the usual 12 to 14 days post-ovulatory.</p><p>When pregnant, the BBT remains elevated for the duration of the pregnancy. Some of those who are pregnant experience a Triphasic BBT Shift, that is, their BBT shifts to a second higher level after implantation has occurred. The second shift is due to the increased thermogenic effect produced by the presence of the human chorionic gonadotropin hormone (HCG).</p><p>BBT alone gives no indication of the onset of FRC events that are useful for timing intercourse to achieve pregnancy, or to avoid pregnancy before ovulation. The BBT Shift helps in identifying the postovulatory phase, and identifying the occurrence of ovulation.</p><p>The baseline or cover-line is drawn 0.05 degrees Celsius (0.1° F) (on the Justisse chart one graph space) above the highest of the previous low, normal preovulatory (pre-shift) BBTs. Drawing the baseline helps in identifying the BBT Shift. There are three ways to identify the BBT shift:</p><p>3 high BBT above the baseline (Roetzer)&nbsp;Three consecutive, normal BBTs that are above or on the baseline.</p><p>3 BBT higher than the previous 6 (Marshall)&nbsp;Three consecutive, normal BBTs that are higher than the previous 6 normal BBTs.</p><p>3 BBT higher than the previous 6 (World Health Organization) Three consecutive, normal BBTs are at least 0.2 degrees Celsius (0.4° F) higher than the previous 6 normal BBTs before the start of the shift.</p><p>There are three general BBT Shift patterns: acute rise, slow-steady rise, and step-like rise. The acute BBT Shift rises and levels off at its highest point within a 48-hour period and, accounts for 83% of BBT Shifts. These majority of BBT Shifts may demonstrate some variability but essentially remain above the coverline. The slow-steady BBT Shift rises gradually taking 5 or more days to reach its highest level, and accounts for 12 % of BBT Shifts. The step-like BBT Shift rises slightly to a plateau where it remains for at least 2 days and then rises again to a new plateau, continuing this pattern for 5 days or more until it reaches its highest level, and accounts for &nbsp;3% of BBT Shifts. About 2% of BBT Shifts are considered not interruptible, that is they never drop below the first high temperature until menstruation.</p><p>Sometimes high estrogen levels just before to ovulation cause the BBT to fall noticeably before the shift. This is sometimes called the “ovulatory BBT dip.”</p><p>A normal preovulatory BBT ranges from 36.4° to 36.7° Celsius (97.5° to 98.1° F).</p><p>A normal postovulatory BBT ranges from 36.7° to 37.3° Celsius (98.1° to 99.1° F).</p><p>A BBT taken under the following conditions are normal:</p><ul><li>After a minimum of five hours rest</li><li>Immediately after waking before any activity</li><li>Is taken 5 minutes (vagina), 7 minutes (oral), or 10 minutes (axilla/armpit) using a glass thermometer, and according to direction with a digital thermometer.

Detecting and charting cervical changes is particularly useful for those with very long or irregular cycles, and who are breast-feeding or perimenopausal.<span> The first change in the cervix is often noticed a few hours, or one or two days before cervical mucus is noticed at the vulva. Thus cervical changes that indicate fertility herald the approach of E-Type cervical mucus.</span>&nbsp;It generally takes carefully observing and charting two or three cycles to be able to accurately detect these subtle changes in the level, position, texture (consistency), and the openness of the cervix.</p><p>During the proliferative phase, under the influence of estrogen the cervix undergoes the following changes:</p><ul><li>External Cervical Os begins to open slightly to allow cervical mucus to pass --&nbsp;softens - soft like the lower lip</li><li>Cervix shifts angle- external os is straight in alignment with the angle of the vaginal canal</li><li>Cervix moves high up in the vaginal canal - harder to reach during manual examination -- elevated estrogens causes&nbsp;the muscles and ligaments to become more toned (Keefe, 1962, 1972).&nbsp;</li></ul><p><span>The closer to ovulation the more pronounced the&nbsp;above changes are.</span></p><p>During the secretory phase, after ovulation, under the influence of progesterone, the cervix quickly undergoes the following changes:</p><ul><li>External Cervical Os becomes closed -- hardens -- &nbsp;&nbsp;like the tip of the nose</li><li>Cervix shifts angle - external os is tilted toward the rectum</li><li>Cervix moves lower down in the vaginal canal - easier to reach during manual examination.</li></ul><p>During the menstrual phase, the cervix opens slightly to allow the menstrum through, but its texture and position remain the same as that of the secretory phase.

It is best to use the <span>same position</span> all the time so that the readings are consistently relevant to each other. As well it is recommended to <span>check the cervix at the end of their day</span> just before charting other cycle events. Once a comfortable position is found, the charter&nbsp;inserts one or two fingers into their vagina, reaching up and back until the cervix can be felt. The cervix feels like a small ball or snout at the top of the vagina. When done daily it becomes easy to detect subtle changes the cervix undergoes.</p><p><strong>NOTE 1:</strong> In the research and anecdotal exchanges the position of the cervix -- high (hard to reach) and low (easy to reach) seem to be less consistently determinable. Rather the experience of high and low seems to be relevant to the individual's experience. However, the experience of open/closed and tilted/straight seems to be more easily determinable.</p><p><strong>NOTE 2:</strong> Because the rectum and vaginal canal are parallel to each other the absence or presence of stool (poop) in the rectum may alter the position of the cervix. One of the rationale for checking the cervix at the end of the day is because it is assumed that most will have had a bowel movement by that time. So, sporadic constipation may alter the relative perception of cervical position.</p><p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2902020">Self-palpation to assess cervical changes in relation to mucus and temperature</a></p><p>Int J Fertil. 1988;33 Suppl:10-6.&nbsp;&nbsp;Parenteau-Carreau S<sup>1</sup>, Infante-Rivard C.&nbsp;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2902020</p><p>&nbsp;Abstract: Women experienced in cervical self-palpation recognize fertile characteristics when the cervix is high, open, soft, and straight; this happens under estrogenic influence. The cervix is said to show infertile signs when it is low, closed, firm, and lying against the vaginal wall; that change occurs quickly under progesterone influence. The objective of this study was to assess the time relationship among changes in the cervix observed by self-palpation, changes in cervical mucus as observed by women, and the shift in basal body temperature during ordinary cycles. A total of 215 symptothermal charts from natural family planning users were analyzed. The duration of the change from the maximum fertility characteristics to the postovulatory return to definite signs of infertility was measured. This duration ranged from 1 to 7 days, with a mean of 2.65. The timing of maximum fertility signs in the mucus was compared with that of maximum fertility signs in the cervix: it varied from 3 days before to 6 days after, with a mean of 0.48 day. The timing of the first high temperature was compared with that of return to definitely infertile characteristics: it varied from 6 days before to 3 days after, with a mean of -0.69 day. Some of the variation may be due to the presence of inexperienced users in the sample. However, a mean difference of half a day between the most fertile cervix and the most fertile mucus on one hand and between the first day of infertile cervix and the first high temperature on the other hand suggest that the cervical changes could be useful indicators of estrogen and progesterone actions.</p><div><p>See also:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://justisse.ca/MediaGallery/HRHP%20Documents/HRHP/UnitC/Cephalad_Shift_of_the_Cervix_Uteri.pdf">Edward F.

On average, those who experience mittelschmerz, report noticing either 24 to 60 hours before the BBT shift or 48 hours after the onset of Peak E-Type cervical mucus. Mittelschmerz typically persists until ovulation has occurred. Fifty percent (50 %) experience mittelschmerz regularly. Mittelschmerz manifests as either an acute, stabbing pain near the ovaries, or a dull ache in the sacrum, lower back ache, or near ovaries, and may last from a few minutes to several hours.</p><p>Mittelschmerz has an unknown aetiology, though the following are suggested: 1) forceful stretching of the ovarian wall during ovulation due to follicular swelling 2) the small amount of blood and fluid released into peritoneal cavity causes an inflammatory response 3) forceful contractions of fallopian tubes at the moment of ovulation.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Breast Tenderness</strong></p></td><td><p>Some experience a mild to intense increase in nipple sensitivity or tingling sensation during the E-Type mucus phase just before ovulation.</p><p>Some experience a mild to extreme engorgement of breast tissue, and/or axilla lymph nodes postovulatory, from 3 to 10 days before menses.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Vulva &amp; Inguinal Engorgement</strong></p></td><td><p>Some experience a mild to intense lymph gland engorgement in the vulva and/or inguinal area during the E-Type mucus phase just before ovulation.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Ovulatory Spotting</strong></p></td><td><p>Ovulatory spotting is bleeding that accompanies ovulation. It usually lasts one to two days, and is no more than a slight, reddish brown or brownish spotting and may stain the E-type mucus (stretchy, cloudy or clear, and slippery). The occasional experience of this type of bleeding is common, though if it occurs with every ovulation it is advisable to see a health care practitioner to rule out any sinister cause of the bleeding. There are three causes for this type of bleeding:</p><ol><li>Estrogen levels rise before ovulation and then suddenly drop following the LH surge that triggers ovulation. This sudden drop in estrogen causes a slight endometrial slough (breakthrough or withdrawal bleeding) that accompanies the presence of cervical mucus, staining the mucus a reddish-pink or bright red. Estrogen levels are quickly restored following the LH surge and thus the bleeding is short-lived and not extensive enough to damage the viability of the endometrium for implantation.</li><li>The tissues of the cervix become congested and the capillaries more fragile during the mucus phase of the menstrual cycle, thus slight bleeding can occur. The mucus is stained either slightly brown, or pinkish-red.</li><li>Polyps on the cervix, cervical dysplasia, cervicitis, or cervical cancer make the cervical tissue friable and prone to bleeding, especially following sexual intercourse and during the mucus phase of the menstrual cycle (see #2 above).</li></ol></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Mood &amp; Energy Changes</strong></p><p><strong>Libido Changes<a>[3]</a></strong></p></td><td><p>During the cervical mucus phase, preovulatory, some experience an increased energy for and an interest in engaging in extroverted activities and/or an elevation in mood. Conversely, some experience premenstrually a shift in interest towards enjoyment of low-key or introspective activities and/or a melancholy or reflective mood.</p><p>Some notice a sharp increase in libido one or two days before ovulation and/or just before menstruation. Anecdotally, many men report being more attracted to the scent of women when they are in their fertile phase, and during menstruation.</p><p>These shifts in mood, interest, and libido are remarkable enough for some in that they are correlatives for other menstrual cycle events, and help to confirm other observations. Considering one of the biological imperatives of the human body is to reproduce, these mood changes make sense in supporting such activity.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Weight Changes</strong></p></td><td><p>During the premenstrual phase, as postovulatory progesterone levels are declining, some may experience a weight gain of about 1.5 to 2.5 kg (3.3 to 5.5 pounds). This is due to increased serum levels of aldosterone that cause extracellular fluid retention. Various factors are associated with increased serum aldosterone levels during the premenstrum -- stress, unopposed estrogen, and dopamine deficiency.

Those with low serum calcium and magnesium levels (and possibly vitamin D) have trouble normalizing vessel dilation in these events, and consequently experience headaches, and particularly migraine headaches.

## 5.4 - Atypical Menstrual Cycle Events {.unnumbered}

### Atypical Menstrual Cycle Events {.unnumbered}

The charter may experience menstrual cycle events in several reproductive situations that deviate from normal parameters, and are thus atypical. These situations include the early years following menarche, perimenopause, the postpartum period, the postpartum period while breastfeeding, post abortion or miscarriage, and following discontinuation of hormonal contraceptives. Additionally, some disease processes and endocrine imbalances may affect the normal expression of the female reproductive cycle. Generally, a menstrual cycle is considered atypical, when menses appears at irregular intervals, menses are absent for several months, bleeding is heavy or lighter than normal, spotting occurs regularly, cervical mucus is absent or becomes gummy or glutinous, or the charter experiences disturbing premenstrual symptoms. Any of these situations warrant reproductive health assistance. The underlying causes of atypical menstrual events are discussed in previous other sections of Unit C, as well as subsequent units. The purpose of this section is to present a synopsis of atypical menstrual cycle events, and is meant to be representative rather than conclusive as it is difficult to account in theory for biochemical individuality and how its expression changes over time in response to internal and external environmental conditions (epigenetics).

There are more details on atypical menstrual cycles in **Unit G Section 6**.

**Statistics do not equal reality, and thus we must always leave room to consider biochemical individuality and individual circumstance and how all that unfolds according to the finesse of epigenetics -- internal and external environmental** **influences** **and individual response to such influences. We must apply science in balance with common sense.**

## 5.5 - Return of Fertility Postpartum {.unnumbered}

### Postpartum (Puerperal Period, Puerperium) Period {.unnumbered}

The **postpartum (puerperal) period** is the time from the delivery of the placenta through 6 weeks following the delivery or expulsion of a fetus whether it is a full term pregnancy, miscarriage, or abortion. By 6 weeks after delivery, most of the changes of pregnancy, labor, and delivery have resolved and the body has reverted to the non-pregnant state. Two notable physiological phenomena distinguish this period: 1) return of the uterus to a non-gravid (non-pregnant) state, and 2) the production of milk in the breasts. Other physiological changes also occur, including a decrease in blood volume, decrease in extracellular fluid, and hormonal regulations to re-establish normal cycling.

The pregnant term uterus (not including baby, placenta, amniotic fluid, etc) weighs about 1000 grams. During the puerperium, the **uterus** shrinks (**involution)** in size from about 1000 grams (2.2 lbs) to 93 grams (3 oz.) by the end of six weeks. This process is more rapid for those breastfeeding. The endometrial lining rapidly regenerates. By the 7th day postpartum, the endometrial glands are already evident. By the 16th day postpartum, the endometrium is restored, except for the placental bed (site). Immediately after delivery, the contractions of the arterial smooth muscle and compression of the vessels by contraction of the myometrium result in haemostasis at the placental bed, which by this process decreases in size by half. The placental bed restoration creates the quantity and quality of the lochia that is experienced.

**Lochia** is the normal puerperal uterine slough of the endometrium (blood, tissue, and mucus) discharge from the vagina after childbirth. Lochia is bright red blood in color for the first 3 to 4 days following childbirth (lochia rubra), and has a large volume. The volume sharply decreases, changing to a pale pink or brownish-red from day 4 to 10 (lochia serosa), and on day 11 a slightly bloodstained, yellowish-white (lochia alba). Normally, lochia disappears between the third and fifth week postpartum, though this time may vary and wax and wane in volume and color. Fifteen percent (15%) have lochia at 6 weeks postpartum. It is not uncommon to experience an increase in the amount of lochial flow at 7-14 days postpartum secondary to the sloughing of the eschar on the placental site. **Breastfeeding assists in the process of the shedding of the lochia.** The total fluid and tissue lost through the lochia is about 8 to 9 ounces. Lochia is not menstruation. The postpartum return of normal menstrual cycling varies according to whether or not breastfeeding occurs and according to breastfeeding style..

Postpartum, the **cervix** rapidly reverts to a non-pregnant state, though it never returns to a nulliparous\[1\] state. By the end of the 1st week, the external os is less than 2 cm open. The **vagina**, which distended to accommodate delivery of the baby, reduces in size to a non-pregnant state, but it does not completely return to its nulliparous state. By the 3rd week postpartum, the increased vascularity and edema of the vagina, cervix, and vulva is reduced to a non-pregnant state, and the vaginal rugae begin to reappear in those not breastfeeding. The return of the vaginal rugae among those breastfeeding is delayed by several weeks due to the depressive effect of breastfeeding on estrogen levels. The **perineum**, stretched and traumatized during delivery, regains muscle tone by 6 weeks. The abdominal wall remains soft and poorly toned for many weeks, depending on the level of activity engaged in to help restore tone.

The return of non-pregnant **ovarian function** is variable and greatly influenced by breastfeeding. Those who breastfeed, have a greater postpartum period of amenorrhea and anovulation than non-breastfeeders do. Non-breastfeeders may ovulate as early as 27 days after delivery. Among breastfeeders, the time frame for the resumption of menses and ovulation is highly variable and depends on a number of factors, including how much and how often the baby is fed and whether the baby is supplemented with food other than breast milk.

\[1\] Nulliparous - a nullipara is a female who has never given birth

### Breast Milk Production (Lactogenesis) {.unnumbered}

The changes to the breasts that prepare the body for breastfeeding occur throughout pregnancy. During pregnancy, estrogen and progesterone, produced by the placenta, promote the growth and specialization of the breast tissue for the formation of milk. Each breast is made of **15 - 20 lobes** arranged in a radial fashion and separated from one another by fat tissue. Each lobe is made up of several subunits called lobules, which in turn are made up of a large number of glands called **acini**. Each lobe of the breast empties itself via the **lactiferous duct**. Each of these ducts open separately upon the surface of the nipple. The cells that line the acini form the components of human milk. Early in mid-pregnancy cells lining the acini, under the influence of progesterone, begin to secrete **colostrum** - the thin, sticky, pale fluid that is the precursor of milk. The ducts mature under the influence of estrogen. Lactation can occur as early as 16 weeks' gestation.

Prolactin levels increase throughout pregnancy, primarily due to the hormone milieu characteristic of pregnancy (that being primarily estrogenic). Prolactin levels are elevated by as much as 10 times that of non-pregnant levels during the 3rd trimester. During the end of the pregnancy high levels of **estrogen**, **progesterone**, and other hormones stimulate the hypothalamus to release **prolactin-releasing hormone** (**PRH**) which then stimulates the anterior pituitary to release **prolactin** (**PRL**). With delivery of the placenta estrogen and progesterone levels drop dramatically and thus too prolactin. However, every time the infant suckles the breast a rapid release of prolactin occurs. Thus suckling serves to maintain prolactin levels for the purpose of milk production.

**Prolactin** stimulates milk formation or lactogenesis. **Lactogenesis** begins in earnest within the next few days. The breasts enlarge further and become more vascular. When the infant suckles on the nipple, it results in the reflex release of the hormone oxytocin from the pituitary gland into the mother's blood. **Oxytocin** stimulates contraction of the fine muscle fibres that surround the lacteal ducts in the breasts, pumping the milk into the lacteal sinuses behind the nipple. This phenomenon is called **let-down**, and it is an obvious sensation. It makes the milk readily available to the infant (oxytocin is also responsible for contraction of the uterine muscle fibres, and thus involution of the uterus). Milk production is based on **supply and demand**. The more the infant stimulates the breasts through suckling, the more the breasts produce. The process, which begins as an endocrine process, switches to an autocrine process; the removal of milk from the breast stimulates more milk production.

For the first 2 to 4 days after delivery suckling by the newborn triggers the breasts to release colostrum, which has already been present in the breasts for several weeks. **Colostrum (foremilk)** is a thin yellowish fluid that is rich in antibodies, minerals, and proteins, and its secretion precedes the production of true milk by about 7 days postpartum. When the true milk appears, it contains all necessary nutrients for the newborn for about the first 12 months of life, and its content of fat and sugars is higher than that of colostrum.

The high protein content of colostrum is protective for the newborn. **Antibodies** are present in colostrum and provide the infant with passive immunity to antigens to which the mother has been exposed. Colostrum also assists in the **final development of the gut**, and the establishment of normal gut flora, thereby severely reducing the development of allergies, and invasion by pathogens. The composition of colostrum and human milk has been demonstrated to change with regards to percentage of protein, sugar, and fat according to the gestational age of the infant at birth. For example, the protein content of the milk from mothers of infants 2 to 4 weeks premature is 50 percent higher than the milk from mothers of full term infants. Human milk is the **perfect** food for human infants, and to date there has been no comparable substitute.

### Breastfeeding and the Return of Fertility Postpartum {.unnumbered}

**Prolactin** is a pituitary hormone that stimulates and maintains the secretion of milk, and is present at high levels during the postpartum through the process of preparation for lactation. Elevated prolactin levels interfere with the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian feedback, and thus suppress ovarian function. 

**Breastfeeding maintains high prolactin levels, and as a result suppresses ovulation** and delays the return of regular menstrual cycle patterns postpartum. Because of this breastfeeding is considered a form of natural birth control. The suppression of ovulation determined by **lactation amenorrhea** (a prolonged absence of menstruation associated with breastfeeding practices). 

**When not breastfeeding** postpartum prolactin levels decline rapidly, and the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis returns quickly to pre-pregnant cycling. 

**When breastfeeding**  each nursing episode stimulates the secretion of prolactin and oxytocin, which continues to interfere with the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian feedback and suppress ovarian function. The longer lactation is sustained the longer ovulation is delayed.

Frequent breastfeeding and breastfeeding the infant on demand (unrestricted) are the primary factors in inducing lactation amenorrhea and postpartum infertility. The **style of and duration** of breastfeeding affects the degree of ovulation suppression. There are essentially two styles of breastfeeding: 1) total and 2) partial

**Total Breastfeeding** **(Ecological or Full)** is when the infant receives no other nourishment except from the breast (no supplements, no liquids or food), does not use a pacifier, and is fed on demand. The effect of ovulation suppression is enhanced when the infant sleeps with the mother and/or has periods of prolonged physical contact. Total breastfeeding longer than 4 months does not significantly change the incidence of menstrual return (see table below).

**Sheila Kippley** defines two phases for total breastfeeding, which she terms ecological breastfeeding. (See suggested reading list Breastfeeding and Natural Child Spacing by Sheila Kippley).

### Phase I Ecological Breastfeeding {.unnumbered}

**Phase I** of ecological breastfeeding has **seven (7) critical elements** that together produce a high probability of inducing lactation amenorrhea. Kippley names these points the “Seven Standards.”

1.  Exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months; no other liquids or solids
2.  Baby is pacified at the breast
3.  No bottles or pacifiers
4.  Baby sleeps with mother for night feedings
5.  Baby sleeps with mother during naps and nap feedings
6.  Baby nurses frequently day and night, and on demand
7.  The mother avoids any practice that restricts nursing or separates her from the baby. 

### Phase II Ecological Breastfeeding {.unnumbered}

**Phase II** of ecological breastfeeding begins when the baby starts eating solids or liquids other than breast milk. This is the beginning of **weaning**. Standards 2 to 7 remain effective, until the baby loses interest in breastfeeding on its own.

An often quoted 1988 study, especially by natural family planning organizations, indicates that the first **8 weeks postpartum** (**56 days)** for the total breastfeeding mother is **infertile**, and that vaginal bleeding during that time is breakthrough bleeding and not menstrual bleeding. There are few other studies to verify or disprove this. However, there is enough anecdotal clinical evidence among those working in the areas of fertility awareness and natural birth control to warrant a re-evaluation of this study. Thus, it is best for those who want to avoid pregnancy while breastfeeding to **observe for cervical mucus following the end of their lochial flow**.

 _It is probably best that the charter avoid following statistical probabilities and attend to what their own bodies are telling them, though they may take into consideration statistical probabilities. After all this is only common **Body Literacy**._

**Partial Breastfeeding** **(Mixed)** is when the infant receives nourishment from a source other than the breast (supplemental bottles, solid foods), uses soothers, is not fed on demand, the baby sleeps through the night, and does not sleep with the mother. Those who are totally breastfeeding for several weeks or months and then change to partial breastfeeding on average will have a return of menstruation within 3 to 4 weeks from the onset of weaning.

A change from total breastfeeding to partial breastfeeding is the beginning of the weaning process. **Weaning** is the process of an infant accustoming itself to take nourishment other than by breastfeeding**. Once weaning begins the return of fertility quickly follows.** When weaning begins, a gradual introduction of supplemental food has less impact on the return of fertility than a sudden or precipitous replacement of the mother's milk as the sole source of nourishment. Part of the weaning process is when the baby sleeps through the night or spontaneously reduces their nursing frequency, which positively affects the return of fertility regardless of the introduction of supplemental food. Nursing frequency reduces at two points: 1) when the baby begins to entertain itself 2) when the baby begins to crawl or walk. Conversely, nursing frequency may temporarily increase when the baby is ill, teething, going through a growth spurt, or negotiating new psychosocial territory.

### Non-Breastfeeding & the Return of Fertility Postpartum {.unnumbered}

The return of ovulation and menstruation in the postpartum, for those not breastfeeding differs from those breastfeeding. Ninety percent (90%) of non-breast feeders will resume bleeding within 3 months postpartum, of which 63% percent will resume ovulation and menstruation. By 6 months, 100% will have a return of ovulation and menstruation. The earliest reported return of ovulation is 27 days for a non-breast feeder

Following a spontaneous abortion (**miscarriage**), induced **abortion**, or the surgical resolution of an **ectopic pregnancy**\[1\] ovulation may return as early as **2 weeks postpartum**.

#### Factors that positively influence suppression of fertility postpartum are: {.unnumbered}

-   The mother's breast is the sole source of nourishment for the infant
-   No use of pacifiers or soothers
-   Mother infant skin contact (especially while nursing)
-   Mother and infant sleep together
-   Mother lays with infant during nap times
-   Mother lays with infant during nursing times
-   Infant feeds from mother on demand
-   Night time nursing
-   Frequent nursing
-   Baby is healthy and nurses well

#### Factors that positively influence a return of fertility postpartum are: {.unnumbered}

-   Not breastfeeding
-   Mixed breastfeeding
-   Baby is unhealthy or exhibits slow growth while nursing
-   Baby nurses fitfully or of short duration
-   Baby sleeps through the night though nurses during the day
-   The nursing mother and baby do not sleep together
-   Mother does not produce enough milk to satisfy infant
-   Mother nurses on a fixed schedule
-   Baby dramatically changes its nursing style or frequency

___

\[1\] Ectopic pregnancy - implantation and development of a fertilized ovum outside the uterus, as in a fallopian tube.

___

### Other Considerations Regarding the Return of Fertility Postpartum {.unnumbered}

**Ovulation does not always precede the return of menstruation postpartum**. The longer and more frequently breastfeeding occurs, the longer is the delay in the return of menstruation and ovulation. However, the suppression of both is most notable in the first 3 months postpartum. Ten percent (10%) who use total breastfeeding less than 28 days will ovulate before the return of menses. Thirty-eight percent (38%) who use total breastfeed greater than 28 days will ovulate before the return of menses. The earliest ovulation recorder during total breastfeeding was at 73 days (10 weeks). The earliest reported ovulation during partial breastfeeding is 35 days (5 weeks). Breast feeders may experience one or more **breakthrough bleeding episodes before the return of ovulation**. The appearance of a clear mucus phase and/or a BBT shift is the best indicators of an ovulatory event.

About fifty percent (50%) of those who are postpartum will have a **shortened first luteal phase postpartum**, ranging from 8 to 10 days. If fertilization were to occur with the first ovulation postpartum, implantation is unlikely due to this shortened luteal phase though not improbable. However, this fact is a limiting factor for postpartum fertility.

Among those in the postpartum , **ovulation does not accompany 95% of the** **first postpartum** **cervical peak E-type mucus event**. Once the first postpartum ovulation occurs the majority return quickly to their pre-pregnant menstrual cycle rhythm. About 10% will experience postpartum thyroid imbalances that affect the return of normal cycling (See [Unit C Section 4.4 The Thyroid Gland: Postpartum Thyroid Function Imbalance](https://justisse.ca/index.php/college/courseware/page/1070) -- scroll to the last paragraph).

**Basal Body Temperature** is variable during the first few weeks postpartum during the lochial flow, and when charted creates an unreadable BBT curve. Thus, it is not a reliable indicator of fertility during this time. The BBT curve stabilizes by the end of the lochial flow. The charter, who observes a BBT shift of four high temperatures above the baseline following a mucus cycle event that is dry or drying up, may assume they have ovulated. The postovulatory BBT curve duration in days is shorter than normal following the first ovulation postpartum. After the second ovulatory cycle charted, the charter can assume they has ovulated after the third high temperature above the baseline following a mucus cycle event that is dry or drying up. The postovulatory BBT curve duration in days following the second and subsequent ovulatory events postpartum returns to normal values when not breastfeeding. Those still breastfeeding may experience a slower return to a normal postovulatory BBT curve (noticed as a decreased duration of luteal days).

Breastfeeding delays the **return of cervical mucus at the vulva**. The presence of prolactin during breastfeeding suppresses ovarian function, thus reducing estrogen levels, and thus stimulation of the cervical crypts to produce E-Type mucus. The fully breastfeeding person generally experiences continuous dryness or a basic infertile pattern of non-peak mucus for weeks or months. Once weaning begins the charter may experience multiple mucus cycle events with no BBT Shift (if taking BBT) or they may notice a single mucus cycle event accompanied by a BBT Shift and menstruation following 8 to 10 days later. The experience of multiple mucus cycle events, indicate that estrogen levels are high enough to produce mucus but not high enough to trigger an LH surge and ovulation. Among those who are healthy, once ovulation occurs, normal cycling is quickly established, as is the pre-pregnant patterns of mucus cycle events.

Those who experience elevated estrogen levels that are not high enough to trigger ovulation may experience episodes of spotting, either with or without the presence of cervical mucus. This is **breakthrough bleeding** or a sloughing of the proliferative endometrium. Once the endometrial lining reaches proliferative capacity it awaits stimulation by progesterone for further development. If this does not occur the outer most layer of the proliferative endometrium becomes necrotic and sloughs off. This is common and normal in the postpartum period, especially for breastfeeders. Breakthrough bleeding that lasts for 1 to 3 days and is followed by an extended period of dry days or basic infertile pattern days is not problematic. If breakthrough bleeding is continuous for several weeks, it may be helpful to undergo a D and C (dilation and curettage) procedure done to remove the proliferative endometrial tissue. It is important in this circumstance to seek advise from a health care practitioner to rule out any sinister cause of continuous breakthrough bleeding (thyroid gland imbalances, low-grade puerperal infection, retained placental fragments, etc.), especially if it follows the end of the lochial flow.

The charter can reliably do **cervical self-examination** to detect any changes subtle changes in the level, position, texture (consistency), and the openness of the cervix that correspond to a return of fertility. Detecting and charting cervical changes is particularly useful for those breastfeeding. The first change in the cervix is often noted one or two days before changes in cervical mucus, and is thus an early notice of the approach of E-Type cervical mucus. It generally takes two or three cycles for the charter to be able to accurately detect these. Those who are postpartum should not do cervical self-examination until **past 6 weeks postpartum** and after lochial discharge gone. This is to prevent PID from the introduction of pathogens via the hands, as the cervix is open and vulnerable to such pathogen introduction during the 6-week postpartum period.

## 5.6 - Coming off the Birth Control Pill {.unnumbered}

### Introduction {.unnumbered}

Recommended Reading: **Coming Off the Pill, the Patch, the Shot, and other Hormonal Contraceptives,** by Geraldine Matus

There are great differences in opinion among the scientific community and the reproductive health care and education community about the effect of hormonal birth control on female physiology. There is clinical evidence to show that many females experience a delayed return in fertility and or normal menstrual cycle patterns following use of hormonal birth control.

A headline in the Guardian Online January 31, 2004 reads, “Women who stop pill face some delay in conception” ([http://www.guardian.co.uk/medicine/story/0,11381,1136021,00.html](http://www.guardian.co.uk/medicine/story/0,11381,1136021,00.html)).\[1\] The article addresses a study that found those who had been on the birth control pill took more than twice the amount of time to conceive within the first two years off the pill than those discontinuing other forms of contraception.\[2\] In the field of reproductive health, this is not new information though users are often not told this when being introduced to hormonal contraception. The author of the study and others in his field assures them they need not panic or be concerned. However, dismissing the findings of this study too readily may be folly, considering the recent publications of several research projects that have examined the effect of synthetic estrogens and progesterone on female physiology and found some disquieting results.

This study and others like it confirm this author's clinical findings since 1978 regarding the process of coming off hormonal contraceptives. These findings include an observed delay in the return of fertility after discontinuing the birth control pill (all forms) as well as other hormonal contraceptives. After discontinuing hormonal contraceptives, it takes the female reproductive system and endocrine system time to re-establish its natural balance and rhythm, as well as counter the effects of synthetic estrogens and progesterone on that system. This presents a particular concern for the HRHP whose client wants to become pregnant immediately after discontinuing their hormonal contraceptive. This section addresses some of what the HRHP might expect in this clinical situation.

_The charter may discontinue use of hormonal contraception at any time, and need not be concerned about any ill effects if they remove the patch, the implant, discontinue the pill pack before its prescribed end date. With injectable forms, the charter is obliged to wait for its effect to wear off if they cannot find a care provider to remove it._

### Reproductive Health & Discontinuation of Hormonal Contraceptives {.unnumbered}

A general review of the literature and this author's clinical findings reveal the following reproductive health dynamics regarding discontinuation of hormonal contraceptives:

1.  How long the female reproductive system takes to re-establish natural balance and rhythm following hormonal contraceptive use depends on:
    -   The age at which the charter starts to use hormonal contraceptives
    -   The length of time the charter used uses hormonal contraceptives
    -   The state of their endocrine function at the time of starting hormonal contraceptives
    -   The charter's individual biochemical response to hormonal contraceptives
2.  Those who start using hormonal contraceptives within the first 2 to 5 years following menarche tend to experience more side effects than those who start use later, and have a slower return to normal menstrual cycle parameters
3.  Those who before starting hormonal contraceptive experience 'menstrual irregularities' generally experience the most difficulty with a return to normal menstrual cycle parameters.
4.  Those under the age of 25 who discontinue hormonal contraceptive use take about 10% longer to get pregnant than those who use other contraceptives.
5.  Those over the age of 35 who discontinue hormonal contraceptive use take about twice as long to become pregnant than those who use other contraceptives.
6.  It takes on average 9 cycles for the reestablishment of normal menstrual cycle parameters after discontinuing use of hormonal contraceptive.
7.  The charter may experience the following deviations from normal menstrual cycle parameters during the transition from synthetic hormonal regulation to normal biological hormonal regulation of the female reproductive system.
    -   Anovulatory cycles (LH surge inhibition)
    -   Monophasic BBT curve
    -   Continuous mucus discharge (basic infertile pattern)
    -   Breakthrough bleeding (unusual or anovulatory bleeding)
    -   Variable return of Peak cervical mucus events
    -   Shortened luteal phase (less than 9 days)
    -   Cervical mucus events accompanying ovulation during light and very light days of menses (shortened follicular phase)
    -   Painful ovulation
    -   Atrophy of the endometrial lining (interference with implantation)
    -   Limited or absent mucus cycles/dry cycles
    -   G-Type cervical mucus secretions (gummy, gluey, yellow) dominate
    -   Heavy and painful menstrual bleeding
    -   Very light menstrual bleeding
    -   Ovulatory bleeding
    -   Some do not experience a return of fertility
    -   Some menstrual cycles fail to return to their pre “Pill” pattern
    -   Weight loss or loss of “bloated feeling”
    -   Return of appetite and normalization of metabolism (BBT)
    -   Reduction of headaches
    -   Reduction of sore or engorged breasts
    -   Reduction in vascular and cardiovascular symptoms
    -   Less anxiety, emotional lability, depression
    -   Disappearance of chronic vaginitis or vaginal infections
    -   Increased libido
8.  Return of menstruation (after injectable or patch forms mostly) on average 9 months after discontinuation, and up to 2 years.
9.  Reversal of hair loss (after injectable forms mostly).
10.  Reduction or end of acne, in some cases return of acne.

 Deviations from normal menstrual cycle parameters after discontinuing hormonal contraceptives reflects both the effect of hormonal contraceptives (exogenous artificial hormones) on the female reproductive system (endogenous hormones), and that system's attempt to re-regulate. As the body begins to exert itself hormonally, menstrual cycles will reflect patterns that are more normal. At time exogenous bio-identical hormones (BHRT) may be needed to help restore normal cycling. (Unit G examines how the HRHP can assist the charter to observe, chart, and interpret their menstrual cycle events after discontinuing hormonal contraception.)

## 5.7 - Anovulation And Other Considerations {.unnumbered}

### Anovulation & Oligoovulation {.unnumbered}

**Anovulation** is a condition in which there is a prolonged absence of ovulation (usually defined as one year or more). The prolonged absence of menstruation (one year or more) is called **amenorrhea** and is a hallmark of anovulation. **Oligoovulation** is a condition in which ovulation occurs irregularly and infrequently. Irregularly occurring menstruation is called **oligomenorrhea** and is a hallmark of oligoovulation. Additionally, intermittent spotting, and either short or prolonged episodes of unusual bleeding are indicators of both anovulation and oligoovulation.

Anovulation and oligoovulation may occur among those of normal reproductive health at some point in their reproductive life span. For instance, anovulation is a normal physiological response to breastfeeding. Both anovulation and oligoovulation may reflect prolonged stress, chronic ill health, poor dietary intake, or be a lingering side effect of past hormonal contraceptives use. Oligoovulation is common among adolescents during the early years following menarche, and among perimenopausal women. However, anovulation and oligoovulation during the mid-reproductive years are signs of infertility or sub-fertility, and often indicate an underlying  endocrine imbalance. (Unit G examines how the HRHP can assist the charter to observe, chart, and interpret their menstrual cycle events when the experience anovulation or oligoovulation.)

Hormonally, there are two patterns observed in the anovulatory situation. One, there are very low estrogen levels with an occasional sharp rise followed by a sharp decline. The low levels are not enough to stimulate endometrial proliferation. The sharp rise encourages proliferation of the endometrial lining, the sharp decline withdraws estrogen support causing the lining to bleed -- withdrawal bleeding. This bleeding is due to the **withdrawal of estrogen support to the endometrium**. Characteristically this bleed is dark in colour and non-abundant. In the above circumstance, a the charter might observe prolonged periods of dryness at the vulva or a variable return of non-peak or peak E-Type mucus. In the second scenario, estrogen levels remain at moderately elevated levels that continuously support proliferation of the endometrial lining. In this circumstance the charter experience variable bleeding events that are not due to withdrawal of estrogen, but rather due to a **breakthrough phenomenon**. That is, the constant stimulation of the endometrium by the moderately elevated levels of estrogen in essence “wears out” the endometrium and in spite of the hormonal support, bleeding occurs. The medical reference term for the above type of bleeding is **dysfunctional uterine bleeding**.

#### Possible Aetiologies of Anovulation or Oligoovulation {.unnumbered}

-   Endocrine disorder (hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis deficiency, hypothyroidism, hyperprolactinemia, virilization, poly-cystic ovary disorder)
-   Past hormonal contraceptive use            
-   Early post menarche      
-   Perimenopause               
-   Natural suppression of ovulation due to breastfeeding
-   Unrecognized pregnancy
-   Secondary to chronic poor health, dietary and lifestyle stress, or acute stress or trauma 

#### Possible Observable Cycle Events {.unnumbered}

-   Monophasic BBT curve
-   No BBT shift for prolonged periods of time
-   Episodes of breakthrough or unusual bleeding
-   Continuous spotting
-   Prolonged dryness at the vulva
-   Prolonged dryness with occasional episodes of non-peak or peak E-Type cervical mucus not accompanying ovulation
-   Numerous episodes of non-peak or peak E-Type cervical mucus not accompanying ovulation
-   Continuous mucus discharge - basic infertile pattern

### Coitus Induced Ovulation and Double Ovulation {.unnumbered}

There is erroneous literature still in circulation that claims that female humans ovulate in response to coitus. Sexual intercourse and the complex physiological processes that it stimulates do not cause ovulation. It is true that the females of other animal species are “reflex” and “spontaneous” ovulators in response to sexual excitation, though should not be extrapolated to female humans. Studies of hormonal levels in women, correlated with intercourse found no evidence that ovulation occurred because of sexual stimulation. However, it was noted that following an LH surge, that several females who had sexual stimulation at that point ovulated up to 2 hours sooner than those who had not had sexual stimulation at that point. This indicates that sexual stimulation may have a role in accelerating the effect of the LH surge on oocyte release. This may have practical application for those who wish to conceive and who monitor for their LH surge.

Regarding double ovulation, the occurrence of fraternal (non-identical) twins testifies that it does occur. Fraternal twins result from the fertilization of two eggs. However, if the ovary releases a second oocyte in a cycle, it does so within 24 hours of the release of the first oocyte. It is physiologically impossible to ovulate and then a second time several days later. The hormonal configuration of the human female reproductive system disallows for more than one ovulation per menstrual cycle. When the first ovulation occurs, both progesterone and estrogen levels begin to rise quickly. These hormones acting together inhibit a subsequent ovulation.

### Aging Gametes {.unnumbered}

Decreased ovarian testosterone production, granulosa cell dysfunction, oocyte telomere[\[1\]](https://justisse.ca/UnitC5Ovulation/OtherConsiderations.htm#_ftn1) shortening and mitochondrial defects, and sperm DNA fragmentation all contribute to reproductive aging. This aging may be reduced through treatments that include reduction of oxidative stress, improved lifestyle and nutrition, and nutritional supplementation. You may find this article useful to deepen your understanding of aging gametes and how to address the concern through nutrition. **[Aging Gonads Glands and Gametes.pdf](https://justisse.ca/MediaGallery/HRHP%20Documents/HRHP/UnitC/Aging%20Gonads%20Glands%20and%20Gametes.pdf)**

Ovulation is a precise event, and there is an optimal window for insemination for fertilization to take place. For many decades there have been various hypotheses\[1\] suggesting that fertilization of so-called “**aging gametes**” - an oocyte or sperm that has reached the extreme parameters of its life span are more prone to genetic birth disorders (e.g. Down's syndrome), especially among those (male and female) over the age of 40. The rationale is that gametes, especially women's, over time accumulated chromosomal damage, or that the proper placement of chromosomes along the DNA spindle is impaired. The research on this phenomenon continues.

We do know that the quality of women's oocytes and men's sperm decline with age. It is believed that this is one of the most common reasons why both sexes over the age of 40 years have more difficulty achieving pregnancy. Among females under 35 years of age, 80% of oocytes produced have the potential to be fertilized, by 45 years of age that number goes down to about 20%. The fertilizing potential of sperm similarly declines. The most rapid decline in gamete quality occurs after the age of 40 years.

There is some evidence linking a “blighted ovum” to fertilization of an aged oocyte or an aged sperm fertilizing either an aged or normal oocyte. 

___

[\[1\]](https://justisse.ca/UnitC5Ovulation/OtherConsiderations.htm#_ftnref1) A **telomere** is a region of repetitive nucleotide sequences at each end of a chromatid, which protects the end of the chromosome from deterioration or from fusion with neighboring chromosomes 

___

### Blighted Ovum {.unnumbered}

A **blighted ovum** or **anembryonic gestation** is a cause of about 45 % of first trimester miscarriages. Most blighted ovum exhibit chromosomal anomalies, and an absent embryo. A diagnostic sonogram may demonstrate a gestational sac with no embryo, no yolk sac in a gestational sac, or an unidentifiable irregular outline within the gestational sac. A blighted ovum is will not lead to a viable pregnancy. The placenta can continue to grow and support itself without a viable embryo for a short period, and HCG levels can continue rise as well. Most blighted ovum are caused by an incorrect number of chromosomes, caused either by an error in the division of chromosomes, or by a gamete providing too many chromosomes.

See [Blighted Ovum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blighted_ovum) for more detail and references.

## 5.8 - Climacteric (Perimenopause) & Menopause {.unnumbered}

The **climacteric** is a period of 7 to 10 years at the end of the reproductive life span during which ovarian function gradually decreases and eventually stops. **Menopause**, which means the permanent cessation of menstruation, is one of the easily distinguishable signs of the climacteric. Menopause is only one of the physiologic changes of the climacteric, but it is the term commonly used for all or any part of this transitional period. Menopause is conventionally said to have taken place when one year passes without menstruation. As well, during the climacteric ovulation stops; reproduction capacity ends; the reproductive organs undergo atrophic changes; and the body adjusts hormonal alterations.

The age at which the climacteric begins is determined in part by genetic influence, and in part by general health, nutrition, and lifestyle. For example, poor nutritional status, smoking, and underweight will influence an earlier onset of menopause; as well, it will be more problematic.

Just as adolescence is a normal developmental process during which ovarian activity begins and becomes well established, so the climacteric is a normal retrogressive process during which there is a gradual physiologic decline in ovarian activity. The climacteric leading to menopause typically expresses itself in one of three ways:

1.  Cycles can remain regular and then stop suddenly
2.  Cycles can vary widely in length between short and long before stopping
3.  Cycles shorten for a few years and then get progressively longer before stopping 

The third pattern is the most common, in which initially there is an experience a shortening of the postovulatory (luteal) phase. Over time, the preovulatory (follicular) phase lengthens as it become harder to achieve ovulation, and when ovulation occurs the luteal phase remains shortened.

A period of anovulatory episodes, with follicular development and estrogen secretion, but without ovulation, precedes the cessation of ovarian activity. Menstrual flow may increase slightly at first, and then begin to steadily diminish in amount.

The basic feature of the climacteric is depletion of ovarian follicles, with degeneration of the granulosa and theca cells. As these cells degenerate, they fail to react to FSH. As a result, less estrogen is produced and there is a decrease in the negative feedback on the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. With less inhibition, FSH production increases markedly in an attempt to stimulate the ovary, causing estradiol levels to decrease. Initially LH and progesterone levels remain essentially unchanged, indicating that the cycles are still ovulatory. As estrogen levels decline, there is an associated decrease in prolactin levels. Additionally, as estrogen levels declinde the health of the ovarian follicles is  compromised, which lessens the ability of the follicle to become an effective corpus luteum, which in turn causes progesterone levels to decline. Postovulatory progesterone primes estrogen receptors, which helps to reset/support the next cycle's follicular development. Without the postovulatory feedback of progesterone the ovarian cycle begins to dismantle.

The stromal cells of the ovary and the adrenal cortex produce androgens, androstenedione, and testosterone. During the climacteric the ratio of androgens produced by the ovarian stroma to those produced by the adrenal cortex is high, and gradually decreases until the post menopause phase when the adrenal cortex produces 95 percent of these androgens and the ovaries produce 5 percent. The androgens are converted to estrone in the peripheral body fat which replaces the decreasing levels of estradiol. The greater percent of body fat the more estrone is produced, and the less pronounced are the menopausal symptoms. The small amount of androgens produced by the ovaries, post menopause, is a result of increased LH stimulation.

Initially the ovaries respond to the increased stimulation by FSH by becoming hyperactive, which may be witnessed initially in the climacteric, by ovulation occurring earlier in the cycle, thus shortening overall cycle length. After a period of hyperactivity the ovaries become hypoactive, i.e., less responsive, and cycles become longer and irregular.

Other physiological changes occur because of the hormonal shift in the climacteric:

Decreased levels of normal circulating estrogen levels lead to alterations in the hypothalamus, which mediate through the CNS and account for the occurrence of hot flushes (75 percent of females). Hot flushes are a vasomotor change that causes temporary sweating, flushing, and flashes of heat. These hot flushes may affect the entire body or only part of the body, and may last from 15 seconds to 2 or 3 minutes; their frequency is different with every individual. With each flush LH, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and cortisone levels rise, but not those of FSH or estrogen. The alteration in hormone levels is an attempt by the body to compensate for lowered estrogen levels. Hot flushes last for about 2 to 3 years and may occur for as many as 5 years, once again those who are obese or close to normal body weight suffer less from hot flushes.

-   Decrease in the estrogen/androgen ratio accounts for the increased growth and/or thickening of facial hair, if androgens are not properly metabolized into estrone.
-   Decreased estrogen leads to atrophy of the vagina, which may produce atrophic vaginitis symptoms such as: itching, burning, discomfort, dyspareunia, and vaginal bleeding when the epithelium becomes very thin.
-   Decreasing estrogen causes atrophy of bladder tissue (which is estrogen dependent) and may produce urinary incontinence and/or a higher susceptibility to urinary tract infections.
-   There are also a cluster of other symptoms - anxiety, depression, irritability, and fatigue post menopause that seem more to be related to poor nutrition and improper stress management and exercise than to lack of estrogen. The body adjusts very well to menopause and the climacteric if healthy.
-   Breakthrough bleeding between menses is related to hormonal changes and seems to be a normal phenomenon during the climacteric. 

Some symptoms unrelated to menopause may occur during the climacteric, and warrant medical attention, prolonged or excessive menstrual bleeding, extreme fatigue, depression or anxiety. Bleeding after menopause is not considered normal.

## 5.9 - Basic Infertile Pattern {.unnumbered}

### First Task is to the Help Client Identify a BIP {.unnumbered}

Helping a woman identify a basic infertile pattern (BIP) is the first task of the HRHP in helping a woman chart, observe, and interpret her daily observations. A woman with healthy mucus patterns in her cycle identifies her dry days as her BIP. The identification of the BIP is learned retrospectively. It is the unchanging pattern of observation of a sensation of dryness and an absence of cervical mucus at the vulva. The BIP has been scientifically verified by the foundational principles of the Justisse method (and its kin) to be infertile. 

Identifying BIP is somewhat more challenging when a woman experiences continuous or near continuous observations of cervical mucus and/or vaginal discharge (slough). Continuous mucus observations are distinctly different from what has been previously identified as healthy menstrual cycle patterns in which there are Pre-Peak and Post-Peak Dry Days and a mucus pattern associated with ovulation and the Peak-Day. Continuous mucus patterns create a situation that makes for a steeper learning curve for a woman new to menstrual cycle charting. Regardless, she can still learn how to identify fertile and infertile days by learning how to **_identify the Basic Infertile Pattern (BIP)_** and mucus patterns that are unique to her.

Identifying the BIP in the presence of continuous mucus or discharge requires the application of the same principles used for identifying fertile and infertile days with some added **_Yellow Stamp Management_****_**\[1\]**_** guidelines, the most important of which is the identification of a **_Point-of-Change_****_**\[2\]**_**. Using these guidelines, those with patterns of continuous mucus or variable return of mucus can learn to identify their fertile and infertile days with confidence. **(See Unit G Section 7)**

There are many situations where a woman might have need of help in identifying her BIP in the presence of continuous mucus/discharge. Commonly, these are after discontinuing CED, postpartum, and when a woman has a cervical health concern. With time and practice the HRHP will easily be able to guide a woman in identifying her BIP in the presence of continuous mucus/discharge. The use of term “mucus/discharge” is to help the reader's be mindful to not make assumptions about what the observation is “cervical mucus” or “vaginal cell slough” until it has been clarified through dialog with the client. This is especially important when identifying BIP and later identifying BIP in the presence of continuous mucus/discharge. The primacy of the consideration for this distinction will be understood by the end of this section, and the HRHP is advised to apply it in all her practices of helping a woman identify her observation with clarity and confidence.

### Feeling “Wet Down There” {.unnumbered}

There are FAM and NFP models that suggest a woman depend on a feeling of 'wetness' or 'dryness' at the vulva to determine fertile and infertile days, and eschew finger-testing for mucus on tissue or at the vulva directly, or attending to the sensation when wiping after peeing or a bowel movement. Depending solely on a sensation of wetness is problematic for those who report feeling wet all the time. There are two possible reasons for this. One, the woman has a urinary incontinence problem and is thus continually wet due to urine leakage. Two, the woman is noticing the sweating of the vulva. The vulva sweats as prodigiously as the armpits, which for some is very wet, particularly when they are physically active, in a hot environment, and/or are wearing garments that are least favourable to wicking moisture away from the body. The vulva also secretes sebum and cellular debris that serve to protect the vulva from urine, menstrual blood, and pathogenic organisms that are looking for dark moist places to settle in and breed. The sebum and cellular material is part of the vulva's ecosystem, helping to stabilize the ecosystem of the vagina and uterus, and may create a sense of being 'wet down there'.  These are important things to consider when helping a woman confidently identify her cervical mucus patterns.

### A Review of Normal Cervical Mucus Patterns {.unnumbered}

Clearly, mucus patterns vary from one woman to the next and from one cycle to the next. However, it is also clear that consistent patterns of mucus appear from cycle to cycle in one woman's experience, as well as consistent patterns appear among the general female population. It is based on these consistent patterns that classification systems for cervical mucus patterns have been developed.

The Justisse Method classification of cervical mucus patterns is based on the Creighton model (Hilgers TW, 1991). This model was chosen because it allows for a woman to independently assess her mucus patterns in an objective fashion, and allows for simplicity and clarity in interpreting healthy and abnormal mucus patterns. The consistency, colour, change, and sensation of the Observational Routine **_3 Cs_** are part of an objective classification of cervical mucus patterns. Additionally, this model allows for a woman to check for cervical mucus without doing internal examinations, which often confuse the individual particularly when they are first starting to chart. That said there are times when internal examinations might be prudently used.

### Vaginal Cell Slough {.unnumbered}

The ecosystem of the vagina depends on vaginal cell slough, or vaginal endothelial\[1\] debris. A healthy vagina is physiologically hygienic in that it contains a symbiosis of microorganisms that inhibit the presence and growth of pathogenic microorganisms. Lactobacilli\[2\] organisms are the primary vaginal residents and lend a “slightly sweet, slightly pungent odour”(Angier, 1999. p.57) to the vagina that is not unlike the smell of fresh yoghurt. Vaginal endothelial debris is the foodstuff on which the lactobacilli thrive. The darkness, heat and vaginal moisture provide the perfect living environment for lactobacilli. Lactobacilli metabolites include hydrogen peroxide and lactic acid, which kills microorganisms pathogenic to humans. Lactic acid is responsible for the maintenance of the vagina at a **_pH of 3.8 to 4.5 on Dry Days_**. Normal vaginal cell slough will appear as 6PC if a woman inserts her fingers into her vagina, or if she has ample vaginal slough discharge she may notice on the tissue when she wipes as 6PC or 4. 

Vaginal endothelial debris is NOT a toxic body waste. It is very purposefully designed to support a probiotic environment, and to that end is made up of albumin (a protein that is abundant in the body), white blood cells, and mucin. Mucin is “an oily substance that gives the vagina and cervix their slippery sheen” (Angier, 1999. p.58).

Vaginal discharge that does not smell somewhat like yoghurt and/or is itchy or irritating indicates that there is an imbalance of microorganisms. This imbalance can be related to infestation by unfriendly microorganisms (infection, STI or other), allergy, and diet, the use of CEDs or IUDs which support vaginal micro flora imbalance, and frequent change of or multiple male sexual partners. This last item is a bit touchy to speak of; however, the concern is real. A man's semen, with a pH of about 8, changes the pH of a woman's vagina and introduces his own set of microorganisms, all of which creates a temporary upset in the harmony of the vaginal lactobacilli village. The village will adapt and stabilize after several hours and generally presents no real problem, especially if they encounter the same intruder from time to time (same sexual partner). The more partners a woman has over a short period of time the more strange organisms are introduced into the lactobacilli village, making it more difficult for the village to adapt and stabilize, which makes a woman more prone to vaginal infections. “Women with bacterial vaginosis are more susceptible to gonorrhoea, syphilis, and HIV infection.” Maybe there is wisdom in the lemon juice douche following intercourse, not as a contraceptive but as a village stabilizer?

### Estrogen Levels / Vaginal Cell Slough / Non-Peak Type Vaginal Discharge {.unnumbered}

The vagina in circumstances such as breastfeeding, perimenopause, breastfeeding, and coming off CED will respond to rising estrogen levels by increasing its production and breakdown of vaginal epithelium. When this happens, a woman experiences a **_continuous BIP of Non-Peak-Type vaginal discharge_** that is typically sticky-pasty-cloudy (6PC) and exhibits no spinnbarkheit quality in sensation or finger-test_._ Using the **_point-of-change_** and **_essential sameness question_** techniques described below, a HRHP can teach a woman to identify these patterns of vaginal discharge as infertile and differentiate between Non-Peak-Type vaginal discharge and Non-Peak E-Type cervical mucus.

Sometimes during the situations of breastfeeding, perimenopause, and coming off CED **_estrogen levels are variably elevated over a period of weeks without reaching levels high enough to stimulate an ovulatory response_**. As it is meant to, the cervix responds with E-Type mucus production. However, E-Type mucus production is often scant and once it mixes with vaginal cell slough, because it is scant, loses much of its spinnbarkheit characteristics. Under these conditions a woman will experience a pattern of either continuous or variable return of Non-Peak-Type mucus. This continuous or variable mucus pattern is different from vaginal cell slough, as its source is cervical, though at the vulva it may seem similar. Typically this type of mucus (scant E-Type mucus mixed with vaginal cell slough) has a white or yellowish lotion-like quality with either a dry or smooth sensation or a stretch of less than one inch (6C or 8C). 

Post-Peak (postovulatory) continuous mucus, either Non-Peak or Peak, type are typically related to **_progesterone levels that are too low to mediate the estrogenic influence on cervical crypts_**, which then continue to produce E-Type mucus. This mixes with vaginal cell slough that is often produced in greater quantity post-Peak to create a continuous mucus situation.

Vaginal flora and factors affecting vaginal flora, hormone levels and factors affecting hormone levels, infection, cervix health, and diet, lifestyle and drugs influence the quality and quantity of cervical mucus and vaginal discharges. For example:

-   Vaginal infections affect vaginal acidity.
-   Cervical infection, eversion, and dysplasia affect quality and quantity of E-Type mucus
-   Delayed ovulation may result in a variable return of Non-Peak or Peak type mucus
-   Vaginal lubricants affect vaginal acidity and upset the 'happy lactos' villagers.
-   Expectorants can accelerate the dispelling of mucus from the cervical crypts
-   Obesity can increase estrogenic influence on the cervix due to excess estrone produce by excess body fat
