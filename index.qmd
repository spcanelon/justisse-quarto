## Inclusion, Diversity, and Language

As a historical note, Geraldine Matus developed the Justisse Method (1987) in response to a growing need for access to secular professional fertility awareness education. She regarded the provision of that to be an issue of social justice, and thus named the method Justisse. She developed a model for providing service without prejudice, including egalitarian regard for sexual and reproductive freedoms. Since 2013 the JCI Faculty Collaborators and administration continue to support and refine her original impetus.

Behind the scenes, Justisse International is working to edit all of its materials made available to the public and to its students and graduates, such that said materials represent all persons **without prejudice** in a way that responds to modern justice-oriented socio-political and psycho-spiritual concerns. JCI acknowledges the necessity of inclusion for a just society, and this version of the courseware is being edited to be more inclusive. The said edits are a complex, lengthy, and expensive process. However, we are dedicated to achieving it. Please be patient with our process. JCI engages in collective consultation with others who have the pertinent expertise to revise all our published materials. We acknowledge that the editor and contributing authors of this courseware may be limited in perspective by their own experience and education. Forgive us if you encounter a text or image that somehow fails to be sensitive to issues of diversity, and social and racial prejudice and injustice. Please bring to our attention anything of concern for you. We are committed to inclusion, diversity and to serving all people with respect for their individual humanity and dignity. 

Because the Justisse Method for fertility awareness tracks the biomarkers such as cervical mucus, basal body temperature, and menstruation, its primary users are people who ovulate and menstruate. Therefore, the curriculum has a greater focus on the reproductive anatomy and physiology of bodies with uteruses and ovaries, though the reproductive anatomy and physiology of bodies with penises and testes is addressed as regards fertility awareness. It is not within the scope of this curriculum to comprehensively address the anatomy and physiology of transgender women or men or intersex persons, though we provide introductory information. Nor is it the scope of this course to address reproductive medical technologies or medical and surgical technologies for transitioning from one biological sex to another, but again do provide introductory information.

We are primarily educating about human biological processes that have not been surgically or pharmaceutically altered. Where we use the word female we are referring to cis-gendered females, that is persons born with anatomical and physiological characteristics typical of the female of the human species. Additionally, the word male refers to cis-gendered males, that is persons born with anatomical and physiological characteristics typical of the male of the human species. We acknowledge that human sexuality is normally diverse, anatomically, physiologically, emotionally, and otherwise. We respect that diversity and support you in learning how best to support others honoring their individual sexual body, experience and perspective. Additionally, we acknowledge that some users of the Justisse Method may not identify as heterosexual or heteronormative. Justisse HRHPS are encouraged to assist those who belong to the LGBTQ+ community without prejudice.

The goal and purpose for Justisse College is not to be political. Though, we acknowledge the inevitability of encountering what is political because we serve to educate individuals who are impacted by socio-political systems - [the personal is political](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_personal_is_political#:~:text=The%20phrase%20was%20popularized%20by,and%20Anne%20Koedt%20after%20Kathie) - and we deal intimately with the personal. And so, by proxy we are political. However, we are not interested in aligning ourselves with the political as is commonly manifested; as dualistic and power-based processes that assume a small elite group should be assigned power to govern the lives and bodies of the majority of others. Instead we are aligned with contemplative inquiry, which allows for mutual examination of assumptions, withdrawal of stereotypical projections onto others, and for all dualities and differences to find harmonious and reciprocal interchange.

The concept of serving without prejudice is an intention which can be understood as follows. As individuals taking on the role of supporting the learning of others who will in turn support the learning of others - we aim to set aside our assumptions of who another might be, and seek to listen, really really listen to what they say and witness what they do and really really value it. We aim to turn away from our narcissist gaze to see something other than ourselves and to value it whether or not we like it. Some might call that unconditional love or regard. We aim to model unconditional love as it concerns socio-political issues, as we understand that injury can only arise when we fail to turn our gaze from our selfish concerns. We aim to have remain humble and be of service. May you who is now engaging with JCI find your way to humble and useful service with this new learning on which you are embarking. Never fear to engage contemplatively in the dialogue.
