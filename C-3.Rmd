The male reproductive role is relatively simple compared to that of the female, though male reproductive physiology is equally complex. Like females, males produce gametes (sex cells) in their primary sex organs (gonads), the testes. Testes secrete testosterone, the main male sex hormone.

The main reproductive role for the male is to manufacture gametes, called sperm, and transport them to the female reproductive tract. When the transport of sperm to the female's reproductive tract coincides with the presence of fertile cervical mucus therein and ovulation, fertilization is likely to occur.

Male and female reproductive systems are equally concerned with achieving fertilization. However, once that is achieved the female body takes over the major portion of reproduction by providing a protective and nourishing environment for the fetus until birth, undergoing labor and delivery, and producing milk for the newborn.

### Classifications {.unnumbered}

The sex characteristics of the male are divided into two groups, primary and secondary.

#### Primary Sex Characteristics {.unnumbered}

The primary sex characteristics of the male are the male external genitalia, penis, scrotum, and, internal to the body, the testes.

#### Secondary Sex Characteristics {.unnumbered}

The secondary sex characteristics of the male are physiological features induced by testosterone that occur in the non-reproductive organs. The secondary sex characteristics play a significant role in sexual arousal and sexual identity. These characteristics develop during adolescence, and include:

1.  Appearance of pubic, axillary, and facial hair, as well as hair growth on the chest and other body areas in some men
2.  Enlargement of the larynx, which causes the deepening of the voice
3.  Thickening of the skin and increased sebaceous gland output (oilier skin)
4.  Bones grow in density and mass
5.  Increase in the basal metabolic rate (BMR) increases
6.  Behavior becomes more active and directed, especially regarding sex drive.
7.  Masculinization of the brain anatomy

### Male Reproductive System {.unnumbered}

The male reproductive system includes the penis, scrotum, testes, male duct system (epididymis, vas deferens, urethra), accessory glands (seminal vesicles, prostate gland, bulbourethral glands), and semen. See Required Readings for comparative information.

### Male External Genitalia (Sex Organs) {.unnumbered}

#### Penis {.unnumbered}

The **penis** is the male organ of copulation. Its role is to deliver sperm into the female reproductive tract. The penis is suspended from the **perineum**\[1\] and is made up of the **root** that is attached to the perineum, an unbound **shaft**, and the **glans penis** (tip of the shaft). The loose skin covering the penis forms a cuff that covers over the glans penis, called the **foreskin (prepuce)**. Many males do not have foreskins because they have been circumcised. **Circumcision** is the surgical procedure used to remove the foreskin.

The interior of the penis is made of the spongy urethra, and three parallel cylinders **(corpora)** of erectile tissue each of which is bound by tough, white fibrous, **tunica albuginea**. The **erectile tissue** is a spongy complex of connective tissue and smooth muscled interspersed with many vascular spaces. The two largest cylinders are the paired **dorsal spongiosum cavernosa**, which form the bulk of the penis. Together the roots of the two spongiosum cavernosa form the **crus of the penis** (pl. crura). An **ischiocavernosus muscle** surrounds each crus, and is attached to the pubic arch of the bony pelvis. The mid-anterior **corpus spongiosum** surrounds the urethra and expands towards the tip of the shaft to form the **glans penis**. At the root, the corpus spongiosum enlarges to form the **bulb of the penis**. The sheet-like **bulbospongiosus muscle**, secured to the **urogenital diaphragm**, covers the bulb of the penis.

#### Scrotum {.unnumbered}

The **scrotum** is a pouch (sac) of skin and superficial fascia\[2\], sparsely covered with pubic hair. It is located outside the abdominopelvic cavity at the base of the penis, and is more heavily pigmented than the rest of the body. A midline septum\[3\] divides the scrotum into two compartments, left and right, in which one of each of the paired testes is suspended.

The purpose of the scrotum is to regulate the temperature of the testes. The core body temperature of 36.2° C (97.2° F) is too high for the production of viable sperm, a process that requires an **intrascrotal temperature** of **33.2****° C (91.8****° F)**; 3° C (5.2° F) lower. Thus, the exterior placement of the scrotum is an essential adaptation for sperm production. Importantly, the scrotum responds and adapts to temperature changes.

When the testes are too cool, the scrotum becomes shorter and heavily puckered to reduce heat loss, pulling the testes closer to the body to warm them. When the testes are too hot, the scrotum becomes flaccid to increase its surface area for cooling) and causing it to hang further away from the body to cool the testes. The changes in the scrotal surface area maintain a constant intrascrotal temperature.

Two sets of muscles control the movement of the scrotum. The **dartos** is a layer of smooth muscle in the superficial fascia, which contract to pucker the scrotal skin or relax to make the scrotal skin flaccid. The **cremaster muscles** are suspensory muscles, which elevate or lower the testes. They are composed of bands of skeletal muscle that arise from the internal oblique muscle of the trunk.

#### Perineum and External Genitalia {.unnumbered}

![](https://classconnection.s3.amazonaws.com/223/flashcards/1190223/jpg/supperineal_m1331834841886.jpg)

\[1\] Perineum - the male perineum is the diamond shaped area located between the pubic symphysis in the front, the coccyx behind, and the ischial tuberosities laterally.

\[2\] Fascia - a sheet or band of fibrous connective tissue enveloping, separating, or binding together muscles, organs, and other soft tissues of the body.

\[3\] Septum (pl. septa) - a thin membrane that partitions two cavities or soft masses of tissue.

___

### Male Primary Sex Organs {.unnumbered}

#### Testes (Testicles) {.unnumbered}

The testes are the male **primary sex organs**. The **testes** are about 4cm (1.5 inches) long and 2.5 cm (1 inch) in diameter, about the size of a large olive. Two coats or layers surround each testis. The outer layer is the **tunica vaginalis** that originates in the perineum. Beneath the tunica vaginalis, the second layer of **tunica albuginea** encapsulates the testis. The tunica albuginea has multiple extensions that form septa, which divide the testis into about 300 small wedge-shaped lobes or sections. These lobes contain from 1 to 4 **seminiferous tubules**, which manufacture the sperm. All the seminiferous tubules converge at the **tubulus rectus**, a straight small tube that carries sperm into the **rete testis**, a network of tiny tubes located on the posterior side of the testis. The sperm leave the testis via the rete testis, travel through the **efferent ductules,** and enter the **epididymis**, which surrounds the external surface of the testis (see “Epididymis” below).
![[C3.1-1-testicle-structure.png]][link to image](https://justisse.ca/MediaGallery/HRHP%20Images/HRHP/UnitC/testicle%20structure.jpg)

The **Leydig cells (interstitial cells)** are located in the connective tissue surrounding the seminiferous tubules. The Leydig cells produce the androgens, testosterone and androsterone, which they secret into the interstitial fluid.

The **testicular arteries** supply blood to the testes, and branch from the abdominal aorta. The **testicular veins**, which drain the testes, arise from a network called the **pampiniform plexus** that surrounds the testicular arteries. The pampiniform plexus absorbs heat from the arterial blood, cooling it before it enters the testes. This provides an additional means for controlling testicular temperature.

The autonomic nervous system\[1\] serves the testes, which accounts for the distressing pain, nausea, and extreme weakness that is experienced when the testes are struck with force. The **spermatic cord** encloses the nerves leading to the testes along with the testicular blood vessels and lymphatic system.

___

\[1\] Autonomic nervous system -part of the vertebrate nervous system that regulates involuntary action (e.g. intestines, heart, and glands) and is divided into the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous systems.

___

### Male Reproductive Duct System {.unnumbered}

The sperm are transported from the testes to outside the body through an accessory system of ducts, which include the epididymis, vas deferens, and urethra.

#### Epididymis {.unnumbered}

The **epididymis** is a comma-shaped structure of about 3.8 cm (1.5 inches) in length. Its **head** (widest portion) caps the top of each testis, and receives sperm from the efferent ductules. The rest of the epididymis (body and tail) are arranged along the posterior-lateral area of the testes, and contain the tightly coiled **duct of the epididymis**. Uncoiled, the duct of the epididymis is 6 m (20 feet) in length. The mucosal epithelium that makes up the interior lining of the duct of the epididymis has long, **stereocilia** (immobile micro-cilia)\[1\]. The stereocilia absorb excess testicular fluid and deliver nutrients to the sperm in the lumen.

When the sperm are still immature and nearly non-motile, they exit the seminiferous tubules in the testes via the **rete testis** pass through the efferent ductules, and begin traveling through the duct of the epididymis. The journey through the duct of the epididymis takes about **20 days**, during which time the sperm gain motility (the ability to swim). The sperm can be stored in the epididymis for up to **3 months**. The epithelial cells of the epididymis phagocytize\[2\] sperm that are not ejaculated within that time. The maturation of sperm is a continuous process, thus, there are sperm in the epididymis in various stages of maturation at any given time.

#### Vas Deferens (Ductus Deferens) {.unnumbered}

The **vas deferens** (ductus deferens) is a tube about 45 cm (18 inches) long. From where it is joined with the epididymis it runs upward as part of the spermatic cord through the inguinal (groin) canal into the pelvic cavity, arches laterally over the ureter\[3\] and descends behind the urinary bladder, before expanding at its endpoint into the **ampulla of the vas deferens**.\[4\] The ampulla of the vas deferens joins with the ducts of the **seminal vesicles** (see below) to form a short **ejaculatory duct,** which enters into the prostate gland.

#### Urethra {.unnumbered}

The **urethra** is the end part of the male reproductive duct system. The **urethra** serves to transport both semen and urine, as required, from the male body, making it thus part of both the reproductive system and the urinary system. The urethra has three components: 1) **prostatic urethra**, which is surrounded by the prostate gland 2) **membranous urethra**, within the urogenital diaphragm 3) **penile (spongy) urethra**, which runs the length of the penis. The penile urethra makes up 75% of the length of the urethra and is about 15 cm (6 inches) long. The penile urethra opens to the outside of the man's body at the **external urethral orifice (****urinary meatus)**.

The **bladder** is located immediately behind the pubic bone. It is a receptacle and reservoir for urine. Emptying into the bladder are the **ureters**. The urine from each kidney is collected and drained into the bladder by the ureters. The bladder is emptied through the urethra.

\[1\] Cilium (pl. cilia) - a microscopic hair-like projection extending from the surface of a cell.

\[2\] Phagocytize - to ingest by a phagocyte, which are cells, such as a white blood cell, that engulfs and absorbs waste material, harmful microorganisms, or other foreign bodies in the bloodstream and tissues.

\[3\] Ureter - the long, narrow duct that conveys urine from the kidney to the urinary bladder.

\[4\] The vas deferens can be easily felt where it passes in front of the pubic bone.

___

### Male Accessory Reproductive Glands {.unnumbered}

#### Seminal Vesicles {.unnumbered}

The **seminal vesicles** lie behind the back wall of the bladder. They are the shape of a little finger and about 5 to 7 cm (2 to 2 ¾ inches) in length. Seminal vesicle secretions are yellowish to grey in color, are alkaline, and make up about **70% of semen volume**. These secretions contain ascorbic acid and **fructose** that provides most of the fuel for mature sperm, which contain very little cytoplasm or stored nutrients. The **prostaglandins** present in the fluid decrease the viscosity of cervical mucus in the endocervical canal and cause reverse peristalsis in the uterus and medial area of the fallopian tubes, which facilitates sperm movement through the female reproductive tract. Finally, the enzyme, **vesiculase**, in the fluid acts as a coagulating agent.

Each seminal vesicle duct converges with its complementary vas deferens where it forms the ejaculatory duct. During ejaculation, sperm and seminal fluid mix in the ejaculatory duct and together enter the prostatic urethra.

#### Prostate Gland {.unnumbered}

The **prostate gland**, a walnut-sized organ, encircles part of the urethra just beneath the bladder. It is encased by a thick connective tissue and is made of 20 to 30 tubular-alveolar glands embedded in a mass of smooth muscle and dense connective tissue. Prostate fluid accounts for about **30% of semen volume**. It is opaque white, slightly acidic, and contains citrate as a nutrient source for sperm, the hormone relaxin, as well as several enzymes including fibrinolysin and acid phosphatase. Relaxin enhances sperm motility. Fibrinogen coagulates the semen immediately after ejaculation, and then fibrinolysin breaks down the coagulated mass, enabling the sperm to swim free of the rest of the semen components into the female duct system. Propelled by smooth muscle contractions, prostatic fluid enters the prostatic urethra through several ducts during ejaculation.

#### Bulbourethral glands (Cowper's glands) {.unnumbered}

The pea-sized **bulbourethral glands** are located just beneath the prostate gland. They secrete **pre-ejaculatory fluid (pre-seminal fluid)**, a clear viscous fluid into the spongy urethra before ejaculation. This fluid cleanses and alkalinizes the urethra from traces of bacteria and acidic urine. Though the bulbourethral glands do not produce sperm, they are located along the route of sperm transport, and therefore the pre-ejaculatory fluid may contain some sperm.

## 3.2 - Male Reproductive Physiology {.unnumbered}

### Adolescence & Puberty {.unnumbered}

The reproductive system undergoes gradual growth during childhood but it does not become physiologically mature until sometime during adolescence. Adolescence is the period of physiological and psychological growth and development during which an individual gradually progresses from the physical and emotional characteristics of a child to full maturation of the body and traits and characteristics of an adult. The adolescent period covers a span of several years. Physical signs of adolescence often become noticeable by 8 to 14 years of age in boys (8 to 13 years of age in girls). Internal, hormonal indications of approaching adolescence are present earlier. At the onset of adolescence, the reproductive organs begin to undergo rapid development, and within two to three years are capable of carrying out their reproductive function. Rapid physical growth of the entire body accompanies this development. The age at which adolescence begins and the rate of progression toward adulthood varies, depending upon genetic and environmental influences.

The changes of adolescence are dependent upon a number of inter-related factors, most particularly upon changes in the function of the endocrine glands. It is at this time that the pituitary gland begins secreting appreciable amounts of gonadotropic hormones, which gradually rise to adult levels. The **pituitary gland** (hypophysis or pituitary body) is a small oval endocrine gland attached to the base of the vertebrate brain and consists of an anterior and a posterior lobe, the secretions of which control the other endocrine glands and influence growth, metabolism, and maturation. Pituitary hormones gradually stimulate the **gonads** (testes or ovaries) to produce hormones and to mature **gametes**. The characteristic sex hormones secreted by the gonads, testosterone in the male (estrogen in the female), stimulate growth and development of adult sexual characteristics. Adrenal androgen secretion in the male (as well as the female) increases during adolescence and brings about further physical development. **Adrenal androgen** secretion stimulates the growth of pubic and axillary (underarm) hair as well as the characteristic “growth spurt” in height (long bone development) and weight.

**Puberty** signifies the earliest time that reproduction is possible. In boys, **andrenarche**, the time of increasing secretion of adrenal androgens, begins around age 8. The events that demonstrate physiological development towards achieving puberty are as follows, and occur approximately in the order given:

1.  Enlargement of the testes and scrotum between the ages of 8 to 14
2.  Appearance of pubic, axillary, and facial hair
3.  Penis growth for about the first 2 years following the onset of adolescence
4.  Presence of ejaculate with orgasm (nocturnal emissions or wet dreams)
5.  Presence of mature sperm in the semen (ages 11 to 15, 13 on average)

The **testes** are the male's primary reproductive organs, and produce testosterone, which supports male reproductive function, and the development and maintenance of male sexual characteristics. **Testosterone** is the primary male sex hormone. The testes are not the only source of androgens. Though the adrenal glands also release androgens, they are not capable alone of producing enough testosterone to support normal testosterone-mediated functions.  The testes begin producing mature germ cells and sex hormones at puberty. The testes continue to function into old age, though there is a sharp decline in function at about age 50. Male **maturation of germ cells is continuous**. Thus many germ cells, in various stages of maturity, are always present in the testes.

#### Erection {.unnumbered}

Enormous varieties of sensory or imaginal sexual stimuli initiate the process of erection. **Erection** is the enlargement and stiffening of the penis due to engorgement of the erectile tissue. Before erection, the arteriole network supplying the erectile tissue is constricted. Sexual stimuli activate the central nervous system to send impulses to the second, third, and fourth, sacral segments of the spinal cord. This activates a **parasympathetic reflex** that innervates the internal pudendal\[1\] arteries serving the penis, and promotes the local release of **nitric oxide (NO)**\[2\]. NO relaxes vascular smooth muscle, causing dilation of the arteriole network and the vascular spaces of the erectile tissue to fill with blood. The blood filled erectile tissue causes the penis to enlarge and become erect. A restricted venous return caused by compression as a result of the engorgement maintains the erection. When parasympathetic stimuli ends, the arterioles again begin to constrict blood supply, and muscles relax. The relaxed turgidity of the erectile tissue due to loss of blood supply allows for venous drainage and the penis returns to its pre-erection flaccidity. The purpose of erection is to facilitate the reception of the male organ of copulation into the female organ of copulation, the vagina.

During the process of achieving and maintaining erection, the parasympathetic reflex also stimulates the **bulbourethral glands**, which release a fluid that **lubricates** the glans penis and **neutralizes** traces of acidity in the urethra caused by urine.

#### Ejaculation (Male Climax or Orgasm) {.unnumbered}

**Ejaculation** is the expulsion of semen from the male reproductive duct system. When sexually stimulated to the point of ejaculation, the smooth muscle walls of the epididymis create **rapid peristaltic**\[3\] **waves** that forcefully expel sperm from the tail portion of the epididymis into the ampulla of the vas deferens. The smooth muscle walls of the vas deferens continue the peristaltic action, forcing sperm through the ejaculatory duct into the seminal vesicles where the sperm mix with the seminal fluid to form semen. Expulsion of the semen, continues through the prostatic urethra, through the urethra and out the urinary meatus.

At the point of ejaculation, the impulse \[4\] feedback from the sympathetic nervous system reaches a critical level, which initiates a **spinal reflex** and a cascade of nerve impulses throughout the sympathetic nerves that serve the reproductive organs. The cascade of events are as follows: 1) the ducts and accessory glands contract and expel their contents into the urethra 2) the sphincter muscles of the bladder constrict, preventing release of urine or reflux of semen into the bladder 3) the bulbospongiosus muscles of the penis rapidly contract around the urethra, expelling semen at a rate of 220 inches per second from the urethra.

Intense pleasure (usually), generalized muscle contraction, elevation in heart rate and respiration, and elevated blood pressure accompany ejaculation. After ejaculation, males experience a **latent phase** during which they are unable to achieve another ejaculatory orgasm for a significant period of time. The latent phase ranges from a few minutes to a few hours or days. With age, the latent phase increases in length, as ejaculatory potential declines.

#### Semen {.unnumbered}

Semen is a viscous fluid, from yellow-grey to milky white in color, and consists of **sperm** and **seminal fluid**(secretions from the accessory glands). The average ejaculation of semen is about **2 to 5 milliliters** (1/2 to 1 teaspoon), and contains from between 50 to 130 million sperm per milliliter, that is, **100 to 650 million sperm per ejaculate**. The seminal fluid serves as a transport and nutritive medium. It contains bio-chemicals that protect and activate sperm, as well as facilitate sperm motility.

Seminal vesicle secretions include: 1) **fructose** that provides most of the fuel for mature sperm, which contain very little cytoplasm or stored nutrients 2) **prostaglandins** that decrease the viscosity of cervical mucus in the endocervical canal, causing reverse peristalsis in the uterus and medial area of the fallopian tubes thereby facilitating sperm movement through the female reproductive tract 3) **vesiculase**, a coagulating enzyme, and 4) ascorbic acid.

Prostate gland secretions include: 1) the hormone **relaxin**\[5\], which enhances sperm motility 2) the enzymes **fibrinolysin**, which inhibits coagulation, **fibrinogen**, which causes coagulation, and **acid phosphatase**, which facilitates sperm nutrient absorption and metabolism 3) a nutrient source that is slightly acid fluid and contains citric acid, sodium, potassium, zinc, and bicarbonate, 4) other enzymes that facilitate sperm motility. Fibrinogen coagulates the semen immediately after ejaculation, and then fibrinolysin breaks down the coagulated mass, **liquefaction**, about 15 to 30 minutes after ejaculation enabling the sperm to swim free of the rest of the semen components into the female duct system. The prostate gland also produces an antibiotic chemical called **seminal plasmin**, which destroys bacteria harmful to sperm.

The **normal pH of semen ranges from** **pH 7.2 to 7.6**. The relative alkalinity of semen helps to neutralize the acid environment (pH 3.5 to 4.5) of the female vagina in the absence of female fertile cervical mucus (pH 7.5 to 8.5). An alkaline environment protects the acid-sensitive sperm and enhances their motility. In an acidic environment of less than pH 6, sperm are sluggish and easily damaged.

___

\[1\] Pudendal (pl. pudenda, adj. pudendal) - the human external genital organs.

\[2\] Erection of the penis is an uncommon instance of parasympathetic control of arterioles.

\[3\] Peristalsis - the wavelike muscular contractions of the alimentary canal or other tubular structures by which contents are forced onward toward the opening.

\[4\] Impulse - the electrochemical transmission of a signal along a nerve fiber that produces an excitatory or inhibitory response at a target tissue, such as a muscle or another nerve.

\[5\] Relaxin - a hormone that simultaneously decreases collagen production and increases collagen breakdown, as well as inhibits smooth muscle contractions. This hormone is most commonly associated with female physiology, where it is secreted by the corpus luteum and its chief role is to soften the cervix and relax the pelvic ligaments in preparation for childbirth.

___

### Spermatozoa & Spermatogenesis {.unnumbered}

#### Spermatozoa {.unnumbered}

A **spermatozoon (sperm** or **zoosperm)** (pl. spermatozoa**)** is the mature fertilizing gamete of the male that carries one-half (23 chromosomes) of the human genetic material. It consists of a round or cylindrical nucleated cell, a short neck, and a thin motile tail. Hamm and Van Leewenhoek, the inventors of the microscope, first discovered spermatozoa in 1677. The cells that line the seminiferous tubules produce sperm through a process of **spermatogenesis**, a process that begins during puberty and continues throughout the life of the male.

#### Chromosomes & Gamete Formation {.unnumbered}

Each human being has two sets of chromosomes, one from each parent. A **chromosome** is a threadlike linear strand of DNA and associated proteins in the nucleus of a membrane-bound cell that carries the genes and functions in the transmission of hereditary information. The term **diploid** (2_n_ chromosomal number) refers to the chromosome number in most organisms. In humans, this number is 46, and human diploid cells contain 23 pairs of matching or **homologous chromosomes**. One member of each pair is from the male parent **(paternal chromosome)** and one set from the female parent **(maternal chromosome)**. These pairs carry genes coded for the same traits, though not necessarily for an identical manifestation of those traits. For example, the paternal gene may code for red hair and the maternal gene for non-red hair.

The number of chromosomes present in human gametes is 23, **haploid** (_n_ chromosomal number). Also, gametes contain only one member of each homologous pair. When sperm and egg join, they form a fertilized egg that re-establishes the diploid chromosomal number for humans.

**Meiosis** reduces the chromosomal number by one-half in gametes, and is critical to **gamete formation** in both males and females. Before meiosis occurs, the cell prepares for cell division and DNA replication. When meiosis begins a specialized process of cell nucleus division involving two successive nuclear divisions, **meiosis I** and **meiosis II**, creates four daughter cells. Each daughter cell has half the number of chromosomes as is typical for body cells, 23 rather than 46. (In contrast, mitosis, the process by which other body cells divide, replicates chromosomes and distributes them equally between two daughter cells, with each daughter cell receiving 46 chromosomes identical to the mother cell.) Meiosis has two purposes, to reduce the chromosomal number by half and introduce genetic variability.

#### Spermatogenesis {.unnumbered}

**Spermatogenesis** is the formation and development of spermatozoa by meiosis and spermiogenesis. Spermatogenesis takes place in the seminiferous tubules. The epithelium of the seminiferous tubule walls is mostly lined with **spermatogenic cells**, engaged in various stages of cell division and cell transformation that lead to the development of spermatozoa. See image of “Spermatogenesis” below. 

![[C3.2-1-spermatogenesis.png]][link to image](https://justisse.ca/MediaGallery/HRHP%20Images/HRHP/UnitC/spermatogenesis%202.png)

**Spermatogonia** ('sperm seed') are stem (germinal) cells and as such are the least differentiated of the seminiferous tubule cells. They are in direct contact with the epithelial basal layer of the seminiferous tubule. Spermatogonia continuously divide by mitosis, and until puberty, all the identical daughter cells become spermatogonia. During puberty, spermatogenesis begins, and from then on each mitotic division of a spermatogonium (pl. spermatogonia) produces **Type A and Type B daughter cells**. Type A daughter cells remain at the germinal layer to maintain germ cell succession. Type B daughter cells push toward the inner open space of the tubule (lumen), where they become **primary spermatocytes**. 

Each primary spermatocyte produces four sperm by undergoing meiosis I and II. During meiosis I, each primary spermatocyte forms two smaller haploid cells called **secondary spermatocytes**. These rapidly undergo meiosis II, and their daughter cells become **spermatids**. Spermatids are small round cells with large spherical nuclei and lie close to the lumen of the tubule.  Each spermatid has the correct chromosomal number (23) for fertilization, though it has no tail and is thus non-motile. Each spermatid must undergo a process of spermiogenesis to complete its maturation and make it viable for fertilization. During **spermiogenesis,** the spermatid discards surplus cytoplasm and forms a tail to become a **spermatozoon (sperm)**. The sperm has four basic structures: acrosome, head, midsection, and tail. On top of the head is the lysosome\[1\] like **acrosome**, which contains hydrolytic\[2\] enzymes (hyaluronidase, protease\[3\], acrosin**\[4\]**, and others) that enables the sperm to enter an oocyte. 

The **head** is made of the flattened nucleus of the spermatid and contains compacted DNA. The **midpiece** contains mitochondria tightly coiled around the contractile filaments of the tail. The mitochondria provide metabolic energy (ATP) to fuel tail movement. The **tail** is a typical flagellum, a whip-like appendage that functions as an organ of locomotion. Sperm move at the rate of 2-3 millimeters per minute. _(See Figures 7.23 in required text Understanding Human Sexuality 2nd Canadian Edition. Janet Shibley, Hyde, John D. DeLamater, & E. Sandra Byers. Toronto: McGraw-Hill Ryerson. 2003. Page 148)_ See image of “Sperm” below.

![[C3.2-2-sperm.png]][link to image](https://justisse.ca/MediaGallery/HRHP%20Images/HRHP/UnitC/UnitC-Sperm.gif)

The time required for spermatogenesis - formation of a primary spermatocyte to release of immature sperm into the lumen of the seminiferous tubules -- is about **64 to 72 days**. When the immature sperm are released into the epididymis they spend about **20 days** finishing maturation, and can be stored in the epididymis for up to 3 months. The final health of and number of sperm in a semen sample reveal events initiated about **3 months** before ejaculation.

___

\[1\] **Lysosome** - a membrane-bound organelle in the cytoplasm of most cells containing various hydrolytic enzymes that function in intracellular digestion.

\[2\] Hydrolysis (adj. hydrolytic) - decomposition of a chemical compound by reaction with water, such as the dissociation of a dissolved salt or the catalytic conversion of starch to glucose.  **Hyaluronidase** is a protein enzyme, the effect of which is to cause rapid spreading of injected fluid into the body, which increases the absorption of injected fluids--for example semen.

\[3\] **Protease** (also called peptidase or proteinase) is any enzyme that performs proteolysis, that is, begins protein catabolism by hydrolysis of the peptide bonds that link amino acids together in a polypeptide chain.

\[4\] **Acrosin** is a digestive enzyme that acts as a protease. In humans it encoded by the ACR gene. Acrosin is released from the acrosome of spermatozoa as a consequence of the acrosome reaction. It aids in the penetration of the Zona Pellucida.

#### Role of the Sertoli (Sustentacular) Cells {.unnumbered}

During spermatogenesis, descendants of the same spermatogonium remain attached to each other by cytoplasm bridges, and surrounded by special supporting cells, called **Sertoli cells (sustentacular cells)**. The Sertoli cells extend from the basal layer of the seminiferous tubule wall to the lumen and are bound together by tight junctions to form an unbroken layer within the seminiferous tubule. This causes a division of the tubule into two layers. The **basal compartment** extends from the basal layer to the Sertoli cell junctions and contains the spermatogonia and the earliest primary spermatocytes. The **aduluminal compartment** lies on the lumen side of the Sertoli junctions and contains the cells in active meiosis and the tubule lumen. See image “ Sertoli cell function” below.

The tight junctions between the Sertoli cells form the **blood-testis barrier** and prevent antigens of developing sperm in the aduluminal compartment from penetrating the basal layer of the seminiferous tubules into the bloodstream. Sperm are not present until puberty, and thus are not available when the immune system programs tissue recognition of 'self'. Immunologically, this makes sperm foreign material. Spermatogonia in the basal compartment are recognized as 'self' and are able to be influenced by blood-borne chemical messengers that prompt spermatogenesis. After mitosis of the spermatogonia, the tight junctions of the Sertoli cells allow primary spermatocytes to pass into the aduluminal compartment.

In the aduluminal compartment, spermatocytes and spermatids harbor in the recesses of the Sertoli cells, which deliver nutrients and move the spermatocytes and spermatids through the tubules. Additionally, the Sertoli cells dispose of the excess cytoplasm shed off by the spermatids as they transform into sperm, produce chemical mediators that assist in the regulation of spermatogenesis, and secrete a transport medium called **testicular fluid** that is rich in androgens and metabolic acids. The pressure of the testicular fluid pushes the immature and non-motile sperm through the seminiferous tubules into the epididymis, where the sperm gain motility and the ability to fertilize an ovum.

### Brain-Testicular Axis {.unnumbered}

The **brain-testicular axis** refers to the hormonal interactions between the hypothalamus, anterior pituitary gland, and testes that regulate spermatogenesis and testicular and androgen production. The brain-testicular axis is under central nervous system (CNS) control since input from other areas of the brain influence the hypothalamus. Below is an outline of the events that take place within the brain-testicular axis.

The hypothalamus releases **gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)**. GnRH binds with the pituitary cells prompting them to release the anterior pituitary gonadotropin, **follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)** and **luteinizing hormone (LH)**. The balance of GnRH, FSH, and LH regulates the production of testosterone and sperm.

**FSH** stimulates the spermatogenic cells in the testes to release **androgen-binding protein (ABP)**, which stimulates the spermatogenic cells to bind and concentrate **testosterone**, which stimulates **spermatogenesis**. In short, FSH makes the spermatogenic cells receptive to testosterone's stimulatory effects. **LH** binds to the interstitial cells and stimulates them to secrete **testosterone** and small amounts of **estrogen**. In males, LH is also called the interstitial cell-stimulating hormone (ICSH).

Locally, testosterone stimulates spermatogenesis. Testosterone in the bloodstream exerts a number of physiological effects. It inhibits hypothalamic release of GnRH, and pituitary release of gonadotropin. The hormone **inhibin** produced by the sustentacular cells regulates spermatogenesis through a **negative feedback** to the anterior pituitary and hypothalamus. When the number of sperm reaches a specific level, the release of inhibin increases, inhibiting release of FSH and GnRH. Inhibin secretion declines when the sperm count is less than 20 million per milliliter, such that FSH and GnRH secretion are no longer inhibited.

In the absence of GnRH, FSH, and LH, the testes atrophy and sperm and testosterone production ceases. When testosterone is insufficient in quantity or absent, all accessory organs atrophy; semen volume drops, and erection and ejaculation are impaired. Thus, a male becomes both sterile and impotent.

### Male Hormonal Development {.unnumbered}

The development of the male reproductive system depends on the prenatal secretion of male hormones. After birth, male infants have gonadotropin and testosterone blood levels close to that of a boy in mid puberty. Very quickly, these levels decline and remain low throughout childhood. The male reproductive system is relatively quiet until puberty.

During puberty levels of GnRH released by the hypothalamus increase. The greater the amount of GnRH released the more testosterone the testes secrete. Rising levels of gonadal hormones, particularly testosterone, influence the changes that lead to the maturity of the reproductive organs. As puberty progresses, testosterone not only prompts the production of gametes but affects accessory reproductive organs, ducts, glands, and the penis, causing them to grow to adult size and assume adult function.

During puberty the level of testosterone required to suppress hypothalamic release of GnRH keeps rising, because the threshold for hypothalamic inhibition keeps rising until puberty is complete. It takes about 3 years for the brain-testicular axis to establish a consistent balance between the interacting hormones and mature. The sperm and testosterone production of an adult male is relatively stable, compared to the large degree of variation in gonadotropin levels and sex hormones among females from puberty until menopause.

## 3.5 - Andropause {.unnumbered}

Refer to Figure 12.9 and Read pages 359 to 363 in required text [Chapter 12 Understanding Human Sexuality](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/170WXmuPrLICht31n8fvKDQUcGQXmQE_g) Janet Shibley, Hyde, John D. DeLamater, & E. Sandra Byers.

Medical texts in the 1940's first described the phenomenon of andropause, as part of the biological aging process in males. **Andropause** is a complex of symptoms and physiological changes in the male associated with a gradual decline the level of androgens (male sex hormones), particularly testosterone in men reaching the chronological age of between 40 and 55. The gradual decline in male sex hormones occurs from the onset of andropause until death, which may be several decades.

The effects of androgen decline manifests in gradual body changes, which may include changes in attitudes and moods, fatigue, a loss of energy, sex drive, and physical agility. Andropause is part of the aging process. Biological aging is the progressive deterioration of cells, tissues, and organs associated with increased age. Biological age does not always match chronological age, and depends on an individual's overall state of health. The timing of andropause and its effects on the individual depends on their overall biological age, though starting at middle age, degenerative conditions such as cardiac disease, cancer, osteoporosis, arthropathy (joint disease), diabetes, dementia and autoimmune diseases begin to become more common.

### Gradual Hormonal Decline {.unnumbered}

Starting at about age 30, **testosterone levels drop by about 10 percent per decade** of life. Simultaneously, the blood level of **sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG)**, a glycoprotein synthesized by the liver, begins to increase with age. SHBG binds up to 98% of circulating total testosterone (testosterone, 5a-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and androstenediol) making it unavailable to body tissues.\[1\] Testosterone not bound by SHBG is “bioavailable” testosterone, and it is what does the beneficial work. As the SHBG level increases, the bioavailable testosterone level decreases. Blood levels of total testosterone and non-SHBG-bound testosterone decrease with age.\[2\]

Andropausal symptoms are associated with low bioavailable testosterone levels. Thirty percent (30%) of men over 50 years of age have testosterone levels low enough to causes andropausal symptoms and/or to put them at risk for other associated illnesses.

Figure: General pattern of age-related decline in total testosterone levels in men.

SHBG levels respond to extreme changes in body weight. Levels decrease with obesity, hypothyroidism, Cushing's syndrome, hyperprolactinemia, acromegaly, and in those taking growth hormones or glucocorticoids. Levels increase with the use of drugs, such as phenytoin, cases of androgen insensitivity or deficiency, hepatic cirrhosis, hypogonadism, or hyperthyroidism.

At the onset of andropause, the pituitary gland decreases secretion of **LH**, thereby reducing testosterone synthesis and secretion in the testes. Additionally, aging testicles are less responsive to LH, which creates a mild increase in blood levels of LH and **FSH** though without the target tissue being affected.

During andropause, cortisol and insulin levels increase with age, and there is a decline in dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)\[3\] and DHEA-SO4, GH, and melatonin, with attendant reduction in sense of well-being, libido and cognitive abilities. Pituitary secretion of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) decreases slightly. Concentrations of thyroid hormone (T3 and T4) tend to remain stable, but the number of T3 and T4 receptors decline.

### Importance of Testosterone & Impact of Low Testosterone {.unnumbered}

To review the importance of testosterone -- testosterone helps to synthesis protein, is essential for normal sexual behavior and erectile function, and affects many metabolic activities such as production of blood cells in the bone marrow, bone formation, lipid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, liver function and prostate gland growth.

As bio-available testosterone decreases, the testosterone target-cell and organ responses decrease, causing many changes. Psychoneurological changes take place that cause a decrease in libido, and mood and behavioral changes that manifest often as depression, apathy, or boredom. Muscle mass and strength decrease. There is an increased of body fat deposits on the upper and central torso. There is a gradual decrease in spermatogenesis, with resulting infertility or sterility, and gradual atrophy of the reproductive organs. Males may still have sperm present in their semen until they die, but sperm motility, count, and viability decline proportional to the decline in testosterone. Also not all aged males can accomplish erections and ejaculation. There is an onset of osteoporosis or loss of bone density, with accompanying joint and back pain. Cardiovascular changes begin, particularly a decrease in heart muscle strength. 

### Andropause & Health {.unnumbered}

Endocrine disorders, emotional and psychological stress, alcohol, injuries or surgery, medications, obesity and infections may all contribute the speed of hormonal decline, the age of onset, and the severity of symptoms of andropause. The decline in testosterone also puts men at risk for other health problems like heart disease and osteoporosis.

In a healthy individual, bone tissue is constantly broken down and restored in a regulatory attempt to maintain optimum bone density. In men, testosterone plays a role in maintaining this optimum. In an individual with osteoporosis, more bone tissue is lost than is regenerated. Between the ages of 40 and 70 years, male bone density falls by up to 15 percent (15%), and is partially due to declining testosterone levels. Approximately one in eight men (about 13%) over age 50 actually have osteoporosis.

The risk of arteriosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) increases steadily during andropause. Certain studies indicate an association between low-testosterone levels and an increase in cardiovascular risk factors in men.

Andropause generally occurs at a time of life when many men are beginning to examine their values, accomplishments, goals, relationships, and life direction, often complicating the male's adjustment to andropause. Each male's symptoms may differ, and the longer a they live the more heightened symptoms will be. There is clear evidence to suggest that the symptoms and risks of andropause can be reduced by initiating or maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including an optimal diet, regular exercise, stress-management, reduction of tobacco, and minimal alcohol intake.

Andropause is often under-diagnosed because symptoms may be vague and vary a lot between individual men. Some men find it difficult to admit that they are experiencing changes or that those changes are problematic. Many health care providers are still unaware of the effect of low-testosterone levels in andropausal men. Other health care providers are prescribing men testosterone replacement therapies. These therapies include the use of synthetic testosterone or bio-identical testosterone (hormone), depending on the medical orientation of the provider, as well as supplementation with DHEA, GH, melatonin, and nutritive and antioxidant vitamin, mineral, and herbal preparations.

 A gradual decrease in nearly all physiological functions accompanies aging, some of which are due as noted above to andropausal changes, and is reflected by a decrease in muscle mass and strength, sexual function and activity, cognitive functions, and the feeling of well-being; and by the development of abdominal obesity, insulin resistance and arteriosclerosis.
