## 2.1 - Anatomy of the Female Sex {.unnumbered}

The female's reproductive role is more complex than the males. Like males, females must produce **gametes****.** In addition, their bodies must repeatedly prepare to nurture a developing embryo for a period of nine months. **Ovaries** are the primary reproductive organs of females and have a twofold purpose: 1) they produce gametes and 2) they produce the primary female sex hormones, **estrogens** and **progesterone**. The accessory ducts (uterine tubes, uterus, and vagina) serve the needs of the reproductive cells and the developing fetus.

3.  Females can observe their vulva - visible external genitalia - by using a mirror in either of two positions: sitting on the floor or standing and putting one foot up on a chair. (See p. 86 in Understanding Human Sexuality) The general appearance of the vulva varies considerably among females. The vulva includes: mons veneris, labia majora, labia minora, fourchette, clitoral hood, clitoris, vestibule, urinary meatus, vaginal introitus, the greater and lesser vestibular glands (respectively the Bartholin's and Skene's glands). The **[Beautiful Cervix Project](http://beautifulcervix.com/see-your-own-beautiful-cervix/)** provides kits for doing self exams of the cervix and has good photo gallery of cervixes.

### Vagina: Notes in Addition to Human Sexuality Text {.unnumbered}

The vaginal wall is composed of three layers: 1) **adventitia**, the internal fibroelastic connective tissue 2) **muscularis**, a smooth muscle 3) **mucosa**, the external thick mucus membrane marked by transverse ridges or **rugae**. These ridges allow for the vagina's capability for considerable distention. As the vagina distends during the birth process, the rugae flatten out. It is thought that the rugae may also have a role in providing stimulation for the penis during intercourse. The epithelium of the mucosa is adapted to stand up to friction and the various changes it undergoes in response to hormonal stimulation.

Epithelial cells produced by the mucosa release large amounts of glycogen, which anaerobically metabolizes to produce lactic acid by bacteria normally present in the vaginal sheath. Consequently, vaginal pH is normally quite acidic, ranging from **pH 3.5 to 4.5**. Before ovulation, due to the presence of fertile cervical secretions, the pH rises from between **pH 7.5 to 8.5**. Menstrual flow also raises the pH to from **pH 6.5 to 7**. Normal vaginal acidity of pH 3.5 to 4.5, which is the pH for the majority of the menstrual cycle, helps inhibit the invasion of pathogenic bacteria into the uterine and peritoneal cavities. The vaginal pH of adult females is more acidic than that adolescent females, which predisposes sexually active adolescents to sexually transmitted infections.

There are no glands in the vagina. The vagina is lubricated three ways: 1) by a whitish/yellow discharge that is composed of mucosal epithelial cell slough and the by-products of bacteria that normally inhabit the vagina 2) by cervical secretions prior to ovulation 3) by Bartholin's glands secretions during sexual arousal.

### The Uterus: Notes in Addition to Human Sexuality Text {.unnumbered}

Normally, the uterus is tilted to the anterior where it joins the vagina, causing the uterus as a whole to be inclined forward or **anteverted**. However, the organ is not uncommonly turned backward, or **retroverted** for some persons.This is not a cause of infertility as is often claimed by some health care providers. A retroverted uterus is an anatomical variant, and may occur naturally or become that way due to changes in pelvic ligaments and musculature with age, obesity, injury, postpartum, or from nutritional deficiencies. (see more below) 

A non-gravid (never been pregnant) uterus of a non-menopausal female is about the size and shape of an inverted pear, weighing around 60 gm (2 oz.). A uterus at a full-term pregnancy weighs about 1000 gm (2.2 lbs.).

The uterus has six distinct sections:

1.  **uterine body,** the major triangular portion
2.  **cervix**, the narrow lower neck, or outlet, that joins the vagina
3.  **fundus,** the rounded area above the entrances (isthmus) of the fallopian tubes
4.  **uterine isthmus**, the narrower and thinner region of uterine muscle (myometrium) located between the uterine body and the uterine cervix
5.  **endometrial cavity**, the lumen contained by the uterine body
6.  **endocervical canal**, the spindle shaped lumen contained by the cervix.

The **endocervical canal** has two constricted ends. The lower end communicates with the vagina via the **external os** (mouth) and upper end with the endometrial cavity via the **internal os**.

The **cervix** is cylindrical in shape, from 2.5 cm to 3 cm (1 to 1 ¼ inches) and about 2.5 cm (1 inch) in diameter. The **mucosa of the cervical canal** contains a single layer of ciliated epithelium, which contains numerous mucus secreting glands called **cervical crypts**. The cervical crypts secrete mucus that changes in quality and quantity in response to hormones that govern the menstrual cycle phases. The importance and significance of this mucus is discussed in detail below in **Unit C Section 2.5 Cycle of Cervical Mucus Changes.** 

The **uterine wall** (wall of the uterus) is composed of three layers:

1.  **perimetrium**, the external serous layer
2.  **myometrium**, the thick middle layer consisting of interlaced smooth muscle bundles, which contracts rhythmically to remove either the menstrum or an infant during childbirth
3.  **endometrium**, the mucosal lining of the **endometrial cavity**.

The **endometrium** is composed of simple epithelium underlain by a thick highly cellular connective tissue (lamina propria). When fertilization occurs, the embryo burrows into the endometrium (**implantation**) and resides there for the rest of its development. The endometrium has two main layers (strata). The **strata functionalis** (functional layer or menstrum) that undergoes cyclic changes in response to blood levels of ovarian hormones and sloughs off during menstruation. The endometrium varies in thickness from 1 to 5 mm, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. The thinner, deeper **stratum basalis** (basal layer) forms a new menstrum after menstruation ends, and is unresponsive to ovarian hormones until that time. The stratum basalis is continuous with the lining of the fallopian tubes and cervix.

The endometrium has numerous **uterine glands** that change in length as the endometrial thickness changes. The significance of this is discussed later in this unit. However, understanding the vascular supply of the uterus is important in understanding the cyclic changes of the endometrium. The **uterine arteries** arise from the interior of the iliacs in the pelvis, ascend along the sides of the uterine body, and send branches into the uterine wall. These branches break into several **arcuate arteries** within the myometrium. The arcuate arteries send **radial branches** into the endometrium, where they, in turn, give off **straight arteries** to the stratum basalis and **spiral (coiled) arteries** to the stratum functionalis. _The spiral arteries undergo repeated degeneration and regeneration, and it is their spasms, that actually cause the shedding of the functionalis layer during menstruation._ Veins in the endometrium are thin-walled, form an extensive network, and are interspersed with occasional enlarged sinusoids.

### Anatomical Variations of the Uterus' Position {.unnumbered}

The uterus may vary in what is considered its normal position. Variations include: **normal**, acute **anteflexion**, **retroversion** and **retroflexion**. Variations in position may be due to physiological processes (i.e. the ebb and flow of ovulatory hormones), changes after pregnancy and birth or may be a sign of pathological changes in the ligaments supporting the pelvic structures. **Flexion** in this respect refers to the position of the uterus in relationship to the cervix. **Anteflexion** is when the uterus folds slightly forward on itself. **Retroflexion** refers to a uterus which is flexed at the uterine isthmus towards the posterior of the body (versus the anterior). **Retroversion** refers to a uterus which flexes posteriorly while the cervix remains tilted anteriorly. 

According to most sources, retroversion is the most common variation in the position the uterus, occurring in about 30% of the time. Variations in the length of the anterior vaginal wall, along with variations in the elasticity of the uterosacral ligaments will alter the position of the uterus, although a retroverted uterus may also occur with certain disease processes such as pelvic inflammatory disease and endometriosis, in which the adhesions which may form change the position of the uterus. Fibroids may also cause changes in the position of the uterus. Low back pain with menses can also be associated with retroversion. 

When discussing variations in female anatomy, there is the dangerous tendency to pathologize anatomical variations. According to the purveyors of Maya Abdominal Massage (Rosita Arvigo: [Arvigo Therapy)](https://arvigotherapy.com/). the proper position of the uterus is central to hormonal well-being. Certain situations may lead to a “prolapsed” uterus and include: falls and especially when the sacrum is injured, high-impact sports, including running on concrete, heavy lifting, obesity, pregnancy and childbirth, especially with poor care and lack of rest afterwards and wearing high-heeled shoes. The Maya outline a special uterine massage to move the uterus back into the correct position. Arvigo therapists claim that many can experience relief from menstrual cramps, as well as dyspareunia (pain with intercourse), especially following hysterectomies, episiotomies, or pelvic floor repair for rectocele or cystocele. See **Unit C Section 6.1 References.** 

### Uterine/Fallopian Tubes: Notes in Addition to Human Sexuality Text {.unnumbered}

The **uterine tubes** (aka fallopian tubes or oviducts) form the initial point of the female duct system. They receive the released oocyte at the moment of ovulation and are the where fertilization occurs. The uterine tubes are the passageway through which a fertilized oocyte (ovum) reaches the uterine cavity.

The uterine tubes are from 7 to 14 cm (2.8 to 5.6 inches) long and begin at the **isthmus of the uterine tube**; a small region, only about 2 cm (0.8 inch) long, that connects the ampulla of the uterine tube to the uterine fundus. The uterine tube broadens and extends laterally (towards the side). Its distal end (farthest from the uterine fundus) is broadest part and curves around the ovary. The distal end of the ampulla of the uterine tube is the called the the **infundibulum**, an open, funnel-shaped structure with ciliated, finger like projections called **fimbriae** that drape over the ovary. Fertilization occurs in the ampulla of the uterine tube. 

The uterine tubes are not directly connected to the ovary. An ovulated oocyte is released into the peritoneal cavity, and many oocytes are lost there. However, the uterine tube performs a complex sequence of movements to capture oocytes. Specifically, the infundibulum bends to cover the ovary while the fimbriae stiffen and sweep the ovarian surface. The beating cilia on the fimbriae then create currents in the peritoneal fluid that carry the oocyte into the uterine tube. The uterine tube aids the progress of the oocyte.

The **wall of the uterine tube** is composed of smooth muscle. Its internal surface is made of thick, highly folded mucosa that contains both ciliated and nonciliated cells. A combination of muscular peristalsis and the beating of the cilia carry the oocyte toward the uterus. The non-ciliated cells of the mucosa have dense microvilli and produce a secretion that keeps the oocyte (and sperm, if present) moist and nourished.

Externally, the uterine tubes are covered by visceral peritoneum \[1\] and supported along their length by a short mesentery \[2\] (part of the broad ligament) called the **mesosalpinx**; literally **“**mesentery of the salpin (trumpet)” referring to the trumpet-shaped uterine tube it supports. The interior diameter of the uterine tubal passageway varies; at the isthmus of the uterine tube has the thickness of a human hair and the ampulla of the uterine tube has the thickness of a pencil lead.

#### Ovaries {.unnumbered}

The paired **ovaries** are the female sex glands. The ovaries flank the uterus on either side. They are almond shaped, and about the size of an unshelled almond; about 4 to 5 cm long and 2 cm wide and 1 cm. thick (2 x 1.25 x .75 inches). Generally, they are whitish-grey in color, and have a glistening, rough, and irregular surface. The size and appearance of the ovaries varies with age, phase of the menstrual cycle, and reproductive stage.

The ovaries perform two functions: they mature, and release ova; and they are the primary producers of the sex hormones estrogen and progesterone. Because of their ability to produce hormones, they are included in the group of glands classified as the endocrine, or ductless, glands of the body.

The ovary consists of four layers:

1.  **germinal epithelium** a layer of cuboidal epithelium \[3\] (mis-named as it does not produce ova)
2.  **tunica albuginea** a thin, tough, white fibrous layer
3.  **cortex**, which houses the forming gametes
4.  **medulla**, an inner core containing the largest blood vessels and nerves. The regions of the cortex and medulla are relatively indistinct.

Many tiny saclike structures, called **ovarian follicles**, are embedded in the highly vascular connective tissue of the ovary cortex. Each follicle consists of an immature egg, **oocyte**, encased by one or more layers of various different cells. These cells are called **follicle cells** if a single layer is present and **granulosa cells** when more than one layer is present. Follicles are designated different names according to their structure at different stages of maturation. A single layer of squamous (scale) like follicle cells surrounds the oocyte in a primordial **follicle**. A **primary follicle** has two or more layers of cuboidal or columnar-type granulosa (grain like) cells enclosing the oocyte. A primary follicle becomes a **secondary follicle** when fluid-filled spaces appear between the granulosa cells and then coalesce to form a central fluid-filled cavity called an **antrum**. At is most mature stage, when it is called a **vesicular follicle**, the follicle bulges from the surface of the ovary. The oocyte of the vesicular follicle is perched on a stalk of granulosa cells at one side of the **antrum**. Once in each ovarian cycle, **ovulation** occurs when the vesicular follicle releases its oocyte from the ovary.

After ovulation, the ruptured follicle transforms into a new structure called the **corpus luteum**. The corpus luteum eventually degenerates. As the ovaries age their surfaces become scarred and pitted from the processes of many ovulations.

Several ligaments hold the ovaries in place within the peritoneal cavity. The **ovarian ligament** attaches the ovary medially to the uterus; the **suspensory ligament** attaches the ovary laterally to the pelvic wall; and the **mesovarium** suspends it in between. Both the suspensory ligament and the mesovarium are part of the **broad ligament,** a peritoneal fold that arches over the uterus and supports the uterine tubes, uterus, and vagina. The broad ligament encloses the fibrous ovarian ligaments.

The **ovarian arteries**, branches of the abdominal aorta, and the **ovarian branch of the uterine arteries** serve as the blood supply to the ovaries. The ovarian blood vessels reach the ovaries by traveling through the suspensory ligaments and mesovarium.

### Anatomical Structures Proximate to the Vulva {.unnumbered}

To see diagrams of the anatomical structures proximate to the vulva, see the illustrations in _A New View of a Woman's Body_ by Suzann Gage, pp. 38 to 41.

**The external and internal clitoris**

The clitoris is composed of the glans (external) and bulbs, body, and crura (internal). See the website [Vulvacademy](http://amystenzel.wixsite.com/vulvacademy). If you would (optionally) like to explore this subject in additional detail, please see these research papers: _[Anatomy of the Clitoris](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7616832_Anatomy_of_the_Clitoris)_ and _[Clitoral anatomy in nulliparous, healthy, premenopausal volunteers using unenhanced magnetic resonance imaging](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1283096/)._

#### Pelvic Diaphragm {.unnumbered}

The **pelvic diaphragm** is the muscle that stretches, like a sling, across the lowest part of the pelvic cavity. It is composed of the two pairs of muscles known as the **levator ani** and **coccygeus** that support the abdominal and pelvic organs. The urethra, vagina, and anus pass through the pelvic diaphragm to their external openings. In addition to its major supportive function, its muscle fibres assist with constriction of the urethra, vaginal introitus and rectum.

#### Perineum {.unnumbered}

The **perineum** is a triangular area located between the thighs extending from the pubic bone, anterior, to the coccyx (tail bone), posterior, and laterally between the ischial spines or tuberosities (the tip of the lowest of the three major bones that constitute each half of the pelvis). Its soft tissues overlay the pelvic diaphragm. The perineum is made up of several pairs of muscles among which are the urethral, vaginal, and anal sphincters. In addition to its major function of constricting the introitus, and anus, it helps to reinforce the structures of the pelvic diaphragm. Most muscles supporting the pelvic floor insert into the central tendon of the perineum. The posterior ends of the labia majora overlie the central tendon.

#### Perineal Body {.unnumbered}

The **perineal body** is a wedge shaped mass of fibromuscular tissue that occupies the area between the vagina and the rectum. Its outer surface is skin covered and lies between the introitus and the anus. During birth it stretches and flattens to allow the fetus passage.

#### Urinary Bladder {.unnumbered}

The **urinary bladder** is a smooth, collapsible, muscular sac with a mucus membrane lining. It serves as a reservoir for urine, which it collects from the kidneys via the ureter. It lies behind the pubic bone, beneath the uterus, and in front of the vagina. Urine passes into the bladder from two slender tubes, ureters that come from the kidneys. The bladder empties through the **urethra**, a muscular tube about 4 cms. (1.5 ins.) long that ends at the **urinary meatus**. Certain muscles of the perineum and pelvic diaphragm assist in constriction of the urethra. The **urethra** is located in front of and parallel to the vaginal sheath.

#### Rectum {.unnumbered}

The **rectum** is the end portion of the large intestine, extending from the sigmoid colon to the anal canal, and allows for the passage of feces through the anal sphincters. The rectum is located behind and parallel to the vaginal sheath.  The rectum, the lowest segment of the intestinal tract, is situated behind and the left of the uterus and vagina. It extends downward to the anus. The anus is a darkly pigmented opening below the introitus. The anal sphincter controls constriction of the anus, which is part of the perineum.

#### Greater ([Bartholin's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartholin%27s_gland)) and Lesser ([Skene's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skene%27s_gland)) Vestibular Glands {.unnumbered}

In the required text Hyde & Delameter, Understanding Human Sexuality on page 86 ) there is a description of the greater and lesser vestibular glands. These are also known as the paraurethral glands. They are thought to be included in the "G" spot and the secretions they provide, especially the Skene's glands (aka female prostate), is female ejaculate. Regarding the source of arousal fluid this source states that the it is only produced by the Skene's glands. Other sources state that **arousal fluid** is produced by both the greater and lesser vestibular glands. Masters and Johnson observed that small amounts of arousal fluid were produced by the great vestibular glands and larger quanities by the less vestibular glands. See these links in Wikipedia ([Bartholin's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartholin%27s_gland) and [Skene's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skene%27s_gland) for a fuller definition that provided in Hyde and DeLamater. The linked material also provides informative links to the diseases common to these glands. Other sources to support this supposition include the following:

#### Mammary Glands (Breasts): Notes in Addition to Human Sexuality Text {.unnumbered}

The **mammary glands** are modified sweat glands, and are part of the integumentary system (the system consisting of the skin and its associated structures, such as the hair, nails, sweat glands, and sebaceous glands). Each mammary gland is contained within a rounded skin-covered breast anterior to the pectoral muscles of the thorax. Slightly below the center of each breast is a ring of 2.5 to 10 cm (1 to 4 inches) of pigmented skin, the **areola**, which surrounds a central protruding **nipple**. The nipple protrudes 0.6 to 2 cm (.25 to 1 inch) from the apex of each breast. Large sebaceous glands in the areola make it slightly bumpy. These produce sebum\[1\] that reduces chapping and cracking of the skin of the nipple, particularly during breastfeeding. The nipple and areola become more pigmented and enlarged during pregnancy. The autonomic nervous system controls the smooth muscle fibres in the areola and nipple causing them to become erect when stimulated by tactile or sexual stimuli. _The nipples are more sensitive to stimuli close to ovulation and before menstruation._ 
![[C2.1-mammary-glands.png]] [link to image](https://justisse.ca/MediaGallery/HRHP%20Images/HRHP/UnitC/axillary%20breast%20lymph%20nodes.jpg) 

Internally, each mammary gland consists of 15 to 25 **lobes** that radiate around and open into the nipple. The lobes are padded and separated from each other by fibrous connective tissue and fat. The interlobar connective tissue forms **suspensory ligaments** that attach the breast to the underlying muscle fascia \[2\] and to the overlying dermis (skin). Within the lobes are **lobules**, which contain glandular **alveoli** that produce milk when lactating. These compound alveolar glands pass the milk into the **lactiferous ducts**, which open to the outside at the nipple. Each nipple has 4 to 18 such openings. Many anatomy books will state that beneath the areola, each lactiferous duct has a dilated region called a **lactiferous sinus** and that milk accumulates in these sinuses during breastfeeding. The latest research out of the University of Western Australia suggests that lactiferous sinus do not exist (Ramsy DT, Kent JC, Hartman PE. 2005). See new breast anatomy image by clicking on this file: [New Anatomy of the Breast](https://justisse.ca/MediaGallery/HRHP%20Documents/HRHP/UnitC/new%20anatomy%20of%20the%20breast.pdf) 

(The process and regulation of lactation are discussed further in Unit G Section 8 Postpartum).

![[C2.1-breast-profile.png]][link to image](https://justisse.ca/MediaGallery/HRHP%20Images/HRHP/UnitC/breast%20anatomy.jpg)

The breasts tend to be hemispheric or conical in shape and vary in size among different females. An individual female's breasts may change in size and shape at different ages, different reproductive stages, and even at different phases of the menstrual cycle. In non-pregnant females the glandular structure of the breast is largely undeveloped and the duct system is rudimentary, and breast size is largely due to the amount of fat deposits. 
![[C2.1-breast-profile.png]]
Throughout the menstrual cycle, hormone fluctuations influence breast changes. After ovulation and before menstruation, under the influence of adrenocorticoids (produced by the adrenal glands), and estrogen, and progesterone, the glandular structures of the breast undergo changes in anticipation of a pregnancy and lactation. The ducts lengthen and branch, some lobular and alveolar development takes place, and increased vascularization and blood flow occurs. This occurs in anticipation of a pregnancy. The breasts may feel somewhat tender and heavy during this time. With the onset of menstruation, and until ovulation, estrogen predominates. There is then a degeneration of the cellular changes that took place previously. 

#### Breast Self-Exam {.unnumbered}

Refer to _A New View of a Woman's Body_ pp. 28-31  to review how to do and instruct another how to do a breast self exam (BSE). The BSE is best done during menses when the breasts are least stimulated by hormones. It is suggested to schedule a BSE regularly, for example, day 5 of each cycle. Bear in mind that the texture of the breast changes, subtly or profoundly, in response to hormonal changes, and so may feel quite different on cycle day 5 in comparison to 8 days after ovulation.

\[1\] Sebum The semi fluid secretion of the sebaceous glands, consisting chiefly of fat, keratin, and cellular material.

\[2\] Fascia A sheet or band of fibrous connective tissue enveloping, separating, or binding together muscles, organs, and other soft structures of the body.

\[4\] Somatotropin A hormone secreted by the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland that promotes growth of the body, especially by stimulating release of somatomedin, and that influences the metabolism of proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids. Also called human growth hormone, somatotropic hormone, and somatotropin.

\[5\] Prolactin: A pituitary hormone that stimulates and maintains the secretion of milk.

### Female Sexual Development: Puberty and Adolescence {.unnumbered}

The reproductive system undergoes gradual growth during childhood but it does not become physiologically mature until sometime during adolescence. Adolescence is the period of physiological and psychological growth and development during which an individual gradually progresses from the physical and emotional characteristics of a child to full maturation of the body and traits and characteristics of an adult.

The adolescent period covers a span of several years. Physical signs of adolescence often become noticeable among females 8 to 13 years of age (8 to 14 years of age among males). Internal, hormonal indications of approaching adolescence are present earlier. At the onset of adolescence, the reproductive organs begin to undergo rapid development and within two to three years are capable of carrying out their reproductive function. Rapid physical growth of the entire body accompanies this development. The age at which adolescence begins and the rate of progression toward adulthood varies, depending upon genetic and environmental influences.

The changes of adolescence are dependent upon a number of interrelated factors, most particularly upon changes in the function of the endocrine glands. It is at this time that the pituitary gland begins secreting appreciable amounts of gonadotropic hormones, which gradually rise to adult levels. The **pituitary gland** (hypophysis or pituitary body) is a small oval endocrine gland attached to the base of the vertebrate brain and consists of an anterior and a posterior lobe, the secretions of which control the other endocrine glands and influence growth, metabolism, and maturation. Pituitary hormones gradually stimulate the **gonads** (ovaries or testes) to produce hormones and to mature **gametes**. The characteristic sex hormones secreted by the gonads, estrogen in the female (testosterone in the male) stimulate growth and development of adult sexual characteristics. Adrenal androgen secretion, in both the female and the male, also increases during adolescence and brings about further physical development.

Adrenal androgen secretion stimulates the growth of pubic and axillary (underarm) hair as well as the characteristic “growth spurt” in height (long bone development) and weight. Estrogen stimulation causes particular changes that take place in girls during adolescence. These changes appear in approximately the following order:

1.  growth and reshaping of the bony pelvis, resulting in a widening and broadening of the hips
2.  fat deposits on the breast, thighs, and hips
3.  development of the breast
4.  growth and change to adult cell structure and glandular function of the internal and external reproductive organs
5.  appearance of pubic and axillary hair
6.  initiation of ovulation
7.  onset of menstruation

**Puberty** refers to the stage of adolescence in which a person becomes physiologically capable of sexual reproduction. Commonly, **menarche** (first menstruation) is the female marker of puberty. However, the appearance of **menstruum** does not definitively determine reproductive capability, as frequently ovulation does not accompany the first few episodes of bleeding. Reproduction is impossible without the occurrence of ovulation.

Once the female attains the ability to reproduce, their reproductive organs go through a succession of changes that occur in a cyclic fashion for the reproductive life span. The cyclical nature of the reproductive system is interrupted by pregnancy, lactation, perimenopause, menopause, exceptional stress or illness, use of contraceptive hormones, or [sex reassignment therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_reassignment_therapy), processes which are accompanied by identifiable physiologic alterations of the reproductive cycle. The common elements in each reproductive cycle include menstruation, follicular development, ovulation, formation of the corpus luteum, production of ovarian hormones, changes in the endometrium, and cervical mucus secretions. Normal function of the reproductive cycle and the reproductive organs depend on a complex relationship between the gonad-stimulating hormones and the hormone-producing gonads. Discussion about the details of these changes from a physiological point of view provides the main text for this section. 

### Oogenesis {.unnumbered}

Gamete production in females begins before birth, as is the determination of the total supply of gametes (eggs). A female matures and releases oocytes from puberty to menopause. **Oogenesis** (“the beginning of an egg) is the specialized process of nuclear division that produces eggs. The process of Oogenesis takes years to complete.

During fetal development, within the ovaries of the female fetus, the **oogonia**, the diploid stem germ cells of the ovaries, multiply rapidly by **mitosis**, then enter a growth phase, and lay in nutrient reserves. Gradually, **primordial follicles** begin to appear as the oogonia are transformed into **primary oocytes** and become surrounded by a single layer of flattened follicle cells. The primary oocytes begin the first meiotic division, but become “stalled” late in prophase I and do not complete it. By birth, a lifetime supply of primary oocytes, approximately 400,000 of them, is already in place in the cortex of the immature ovary, where they remain in suspended animation for 10 to 14 years until adolescence.

Beginning at puberty, a small number of primary oocytes are activated in each cycle. However, only one is “selected” to continue **meiosis I**, ultimately producing two **haploid cells**, each with 23 replicated chromosomes, which are different in size. The smaller cell is the **first polar body**. The larger cell, which contains nearly all the cytoplasm of the primary oocyte, is the **secondary oocyte**. During the first maturation division, a spindle forms at the very edge of the oocyte, and a little nipple, into which the polar body chromosomes are cast, appears near the edge. This sets up the polarity of the oocyte and ensures that the polar body receives almost no cytoplasm or organelles.![[C2.2-oogenesis.png]][link to image](https://justisse.ca/MediaGallery/HRHP%20Images/HRHP/UnitC/Oogenisis%20female.jpg) 

The first polar body usually undergoes **meiosis II**, producing two even smaller bodies. In females, the secondary oocyte arrests in development part way through meiosis II in **metaphase II**. The secondary oocyte at this stage of meiosis II is this cell that is ovulated, not a functional ovum. If a sperm does not penetrate an ovulated secondary oocyte, it simply deteriorates. But, if sperm penetration does occur, it quickly completes meiosis II, yielding one large **ovum** and a tiny **second polar body**. The products of oogenesis are usually three tiny polar bodies, nearly devoid of cytoplasm, and one large ovum. All of these cells are haploid, but only the ovum is a **functional gamete**.

The unequal division of cytoplasm that occurs during oogenesis ensures that a fertilized egg has enough nutrients for its 7-day journey along the uterine tube to the uterus after fertilization. Without nutrient-rich cytoplasm the polar bodies degenerate and die. Since the female reproductive life is only from 35 to 40 years, and usually only one ovulation occurs each cycle, fewer than 500 oocytes out a potential of about 400,000 are released during a female's lifetime.  

### The Reproductive Cycle and Basal Body Temperature (BBT) Changes {.unnumbered}

#### Basal Metabolic Rate & Basal Body Temperature {.unnumbered}

The term **metabolic rate** refers to the body's rate of energy output (usually expressed per hour). The energy output includes the total heat produced by all the chemical reactions and mechanical work of the body. **Basal metabolic rate (BMR)** refers to the measurement of metabolic rate under a standardized laboratory condition, and is meant to reflect the energy the body requires for involuntary physiological function. The lowest metabolic state occurs during sleep. Generally, the younger a person is the higher their BMR. BMR declines dramatically in the elderly. Males tend to have a higher BMR than females.

BMR rises and falls with the **basal body temperature** (BBT). **Stress**, emotional or physical, causes the adrenal gland to release **norepinephrine** \[1\] and **epinephrine** \[2\] into the bloodstream, thereby mobilizing the sympathetic nervous system. The mobilization of the sympathetic nervous system primarily stimulates fat catabolism (metabolic breakdown), which is responsible for the rise in BMR and BBT. However, **thyroxin (**the “metabolic hormone”)is the most important hormonal factor in determining BMR and BBT.

**Thyroxin (T****4****)** is an iodine-containing hormone produced by the **thyroid gland**. Thyroxin directly affects all body cells with the exception of brain cells. It is responsible to increase the rate of cell metabolism, regulate growth, increase oxygen consumption, accelerate the use of ATP \[3\] for sodium-potassium regulation, and accelerate cellular respiration. The more thyroxin that is produced the higher the BMR and BBT. Before the development of blood tests for thyroid function, BMR and BBT tests were used to measure the sufficiency of the thyroid gland to produce adequate amounts of thyroxin. (See your required text Solved the Riddle of Illness by Stephen Langer.)

The **hypothalamus** works with the thyroid gland in the regulation of BBT. (It is important to note that the hypothalamic-pituitary-target endocrine organ feedback loop is at the core of all endocrine function.) When the BBT falls below normal the hypothalamus releases **thyrotropin-releasing hormone**, which activates the anterior pituitary to release **thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)**. TSH induces the thyroid gland to release larger amount of the thyroid hormones thyroxin (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) into the blood stream. The hypothalamus is also similarly stimulated by the release of norepinephrine and epinephrine in response to stress. 

\[1\] Norepinephrine (noradrenaline) - a hormone and neurotransmitter, secreted by the adrenal medulla and the nerve endings of the sympathetic nervous system to cause vasoconstriction and increases in heart rate, blood pressure, and sugar level of the blood.

\[2\] Epinephrine (adrenaline) - a hormone secreted by the adrenal medulla in response to physical or mental stress, which initiates many bodily responses, including the stimulation of heart action and an increase in blood pressure, metabolic rate, and blood glucose concentration.

\[3\] ATP - and adenosine-derived nucleotide containing high-energy phosphate bonds that is used to transport energy to cells for biochemical processes, including muscle contraction and enzymatic metabolism, through its hydrolysis to ADP. ADP is a nucleotide composed of adenosine and two linked phosphate groups that are converted to ATP for the storage of energy.

3.  Refer to page 7 in _Justisse Method for Fertility Management: A User's Guide_. Geraldine Matus. 2009. The **ovarian cycle** refers to the series of events associated with the maturation of an egg. The ovarian cycle has two distinct phases: 1) **follicular phase**, the period of follicle growth before ovulation 2) **luteal phase**, the period of corpus luteum activity following ovulation and which is typically 12 to 14 days long. **Ovulation** is the mid-point between the follicular and luteal phases.

___

## Female Sexual Anatomy and Physiology {.unnumbered}

### Follicular Phase {.unnumbered}

**1) Primordial Follicle changes to a Primary Follicle**

The primordial follicles are hormonally activated. **Squamous cells** surrounding the primary oocyte grow and become **cuboidal cells**, and the oocyte enlarges. The follicle is now a primary follicle.

**2) Primary Follicle changes to a Secondary Follicle**

The follicle cells of the primary follicle proliferate until they form a stratified epithelium around the oocyte. When more than one cell layer is present the follicular cells are named granulosa cells. The developing oocyte is connected to the granulosa cells by **gap junctions**, through which passes ions, metabolites, and signal molecules that communicate to the oocyte what to do, for example “to grow.”

A layer of connective tissue forms around the follicle, forming the **theca folliculi**. Granulosa cells continue to divide, and the follicle to grow. The thecal and granulosa cells cooperate to produce estrogens.\[1\] Simultaneously, the granulosa cells secrete a thick, transparent and glycoprotein-rich membrane around the oocyte, called the **zona pellucida**.

Clear liquid accumulates between the granulosa cells and eventually coalesces to form the **antrum**, a fluid-filled cavity. The presence of an antrum distinguishes the secondary follicle from the primary follicle.

**3) Secondary Follicle changes to a Vesicular (Graafian) Follicle**

The antrum expands with fluid until it isolates the oocyte within its surrounding capsule of granulosa cells (**corona radiata**) on a stalk on one side of the follicle. When a follicle reaches its full size of 10 to 15 mm in diameter, it becomes a vesicular follicle and is a prominent swelling on the external ovarian surface.

Finally, the primary oocyte completes meiosis I to create the secondary oocyte and first polar body, then arrests in meiosis II until ovulation occurs, and does not complete meiosis II until fertilization occurs.

### Ovulation {.unnumbered}

**Ovulation** occurs when the swelling ovary wall ruptures and releases the secondary oocyte still surrounded by its corona radiata into the peritoneal cavity. As many as 20 follicles develop during each cycle. These developing follicles all produce estrogen and compete for viability until finally one, the **dominant follicle or Graafian follicle** is chosen to reach full maturity. How this follicle is selected, or selects itself is still unknown. The remaining follicles undergo **atresia** (see “follicular atresia” below). When more than one mature follicle release oocytes that are fertilized, the results are fraternal twins or triplets. This occurs in 1% to 2% of all ovulations, with this incidence increasing with age. Identical twins result from the fertilization of a single oocyte by a single sperm, followed by separation, in early development, of the fertilized egg's daughter cells.

### Follicular Atresia {.unnumbered}

The majority of primary follicles that begin development degenerate before they reach maturity. The process of the degeneration and resorption of one or more ovarian follicles before reaching maturity is called **follicular atresia**. When partly developed, the follicles undergo retrogressive changes, during which the oocyte undergoes **cytolysis**, dissolution and destruction. This process of follicular atresia begins during fetal life and continues until after menopause. It is particularly active before puberty and during pregnancy.

### Luteal Phase {.unnumbered}

Once the fluid from the antrum and the ovum are released, the ruptured follicle collapses and the antrum fills with clotted blood. The blood filled antrum is called a **corpus hemorrhagicum**, and is eventually absorbed. The granulosa cells remaining in the follicle increase in size and number and assume a yellowish tint due to the presence of beta-carotene, and are now called **granulosa lutein cells**. The granulosa lutein cells along with the internal thecal cells form the **corpus luteum** (“yellow body”). The corpus luteum functions as a temporary endocrine gland. The typical hormone it secretes is progesterone, along with some estrogen.  Rapid changes take place in development of the corpus luteum, under the influence of the luteinizing hormone (LH) secreted by the anterior pituitary gland (see “hormonal control of the ovarian cycle” below). The corpus luteum continues activity and growth for about 8 days reaching a diameter of about 10 to 20 mm. Whether or not the ovum is fertilized determines the next physiological events regarding the corpus luteum.

If fertilization does not take place the corpus luteum begins to degenerate by about days 8 to 10 following ovulation. It ceases to secrete hormones, and is then called the **corpus luteum of menstruation**. Menstruation begins in about 2 to 4 days, by which time the degeneration of the corpus luteum is complete. The degenerated cells are absorbed and the corpus luteum is replaced by a connective tissue, and what remains is dull white scar called the **corpus albicans**.

If the oocyte is fertilized and pregnancy results, the existence and activity of the corpus luteum persists until the placenta is takes over the secretion of progesterone and estrogen at about 12 weeks gestation, and is called the **corpus luteum of gestation**. The corpus luteum of gestation becomes larger than the corpus luteum of menstruation and may occupy as much as one third (1/3) of the ovary. It functions optimally during the first two months of pregnancy, continues good function for another few weeks, and then, at about the third month of pregnancy, begins to undergo degenerative changes and decreases secretory activity. The placenta begins production of progesterone and estrogen from its earliest development, though is not capable of secreting sufficient amount to sustain pregnancy until about 12 weeks gestation. The shift in primary hormone support between the placenta and the corpus luteum of gestation is critical to maintaining a viable pregnancy.

### Estrogens {.unnumbered}

The word 'estrogens' means 'generators of sexual activity'. Estrogen refers collectively to any one of several steroid hormones, which are produced mainly by the ovaries and are responsible for promoting estrus and the development and maintenance of female secondary sex characteristics. Ovarian estrogens include **estradiol**, **estrone** or theelin, and **estriol** or theelol. Of these, **estradiol or E2 is the most abundant and is most responsible for mediating estrogenic effects**. During pregnancy, the placenta is a major source of estrogen. The adrenal glands produce a small amount of estrogen through the peripheral conversion of testosterone to estrogen. Females' estradiol production is as important as testosterone production is for males. Estrogen continues to support and maintain the changes it induces during adolescence (items 1 to 11):

1.  To promote oogenesis and follicle growth in the ovary
2.  Exert anabolic effects on the female reproductive tract
3.  Cause the uterine tubes, uterus, and vagina to grow larger and become functional
4.  Increase motility of the uterine tubes and uterus
5.  Promote changes in the cervical mucus secretions
6.  Cause the vaginal mucosa to thicken
7.  Cause the external genitalia to mature
8.  Support the growth spurt at adolescence
9.  Create closure of the epiphyses \[1\] of the long bones
10.  Induce growth of the secondary sex characteristics _(Growth of the breasts, Increased deposit of subcutaneous fat (especially hips and breasts), Widening and lightening of the pelvis, in adaptation for childbirth, Growth of axillary (underarm) and pubic hair)_
11.  Support metabolic changes that include maintaining low total blood cholesterol levels and high HDL levels (cardiovascular sparing effect)
12.  Facilitates calcium uptake which sustains bone density
13.  Is the stimulus for the release of FSH and some LH
14.  Exerts both positive and negative feedback on anterior pituitary release of gonadotropin
15.  Acts with progesterone during pregnancy to prepare the breasts for lactation
16.  During pregnancy acts with the hormone relaxin to induce softening and relaxation of the pelvic ligaments and pubic symphysis
17.  Stimulates sodium (NA) resorption by the renal tubules, hence inhibits diuresis
18.  Promotes hydration of the skin

___

\[1\] Epiphysis - the end of a long bone that is originally separated from the main bone by a layer of cartilage but later becomes united to the main bone through ossification. 

___

### Progesterone {.unnumbered}

Progesterone works with estrogen to establish, maintain, and regulate the reproductive cycle. The main source of progesterone is from the corpus luteum, and during pregnancy from the placenta. However, the adrenal cortex does secrete low levels of progesterone throughout the menstrual cycle, though at levels about 50 times less than the levels secreted by the corpus luteum.

1.  It promotes changes in cervical mucus secretions
2.  During pregnancy it inhibits the motility of the uterus - quiets the myometrium
3.  Maintains the endometrium for implantation
4.  Maintains pregnancy
5.  Prepares the breasts for lactation (stimulates formation of alveoli)
6.  Raise basal metabolic rate and increases basal body temperature
7.  Promotes diuresis (anti-estrogenic effect)
8.  The effect of LH on the corpus luteum is the main stimulus for the release of progesterone
9.  Exerts negative feedback on anterior pituitary release of gonadotropins

### How the Ovarian Cycle First Begins {.unnumbered}

The ovaries grow during childhood and continuously secrete small amounts of estrogens. These estrogens inhibit the release of GnRH\[1\] from the hypothalamus. As puberty approaches, the hypothalamus becomes desensitized to estrogen, which allows it to begin releasing GnRH in rhythmic pulses. GnRH stimulates the anterior pituitary to release FSH and LH. The output of **gonadotropin**, the hormone that stimulate the growth and activity of the ovaries, increase for about 3 to 5 years. During these years, young females are anovulatory and not able to become pregnant until a mature ovarian cyclic pattern is established, that is until they reach puberty. The first menstruation or **menarche** ('arche' = first and 'men' = month) confirms this. The ovarian cycle does not achieve regularity until about the three (3) to five (5) years after menarche (**post menarche**).

___

\[1\] The feedback inhibition of GnRH secretion by estrogens and progesterone is the basis for hormonal contraceptives, which include many different formulations and/or combinations of **synthetic estrogens** and **progestins** (synthetic progesterone). They **inhibit GnRH** production and the preovulatory **LH** surge. 

___

### Hormonal Feedback Interactions during the Ovarian Cycle {.unnumbered}

A continuous hormonal feedback between the central nervous system, hypothalamus, anterior pituitary gland, and ovaries governs the ovarian cycle. This feedback is both positive and negative (negative feedback is the most common form), and follows a cyclic pattern with blood hormone levels varying according to the particular phase of the ovarian cycle. The level of one hormone influences the production and release of other hormones either directly or indirectly.

The regulatory principle of negative feedback is comparable to a thermostat. If a heater thermostat is set for 25 °C, and the room temperature rises above 25, a relay switch in the thermostat stops the power supply to the heater. If the temperature drops below 25 the switch turns on, reconnecting power to the heater.

Particular stimuli will activate specialized neurons in the brain to release neurotransmitter molecules, which act as messengers, which target neurosecretory cells in the **hypothalamus** \[1\] gland. (Stimuli may be external or internal, such as a change in hormone levels.) When the hypothalamus receives the neurotransmitter message, it responds by synthesizing and releasing several different neurohormones (**releasing factors**) that stimulate the pituitary. In responding to a message concerning the ovarian cycle, the hypothalamus discharges **gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)**. The interaction between GnRH, **pituitary gonadotropin (LH and FSH)**, and **estrogen** and **progesterone** produced by the ovaries create the events that make up the ovarian cycle.

Each of the reproductive hormones will be discussed in detail below. Briefly, the **hypothalamus** produces **GnRH**, also known as luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH), which acts as a signal to the anterior pituitary gland to secrete **luteinizing hormone (LH)** and **follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)**. The anterior lobe of the pituitary gland produces LH and FSH. For females, **LH** is responsible to stimulate ovulation and the development of the corpus luteum, and **FSH** is responsible to stimulate the growth of ovarian follicles. As the follicle grows, it secretes increasing amounts of estrogens, primarily estradiol. **Ovarian estrogen** is a steroid hormone chiefly responsible for the proliferation of the endometrium, promoting estrus, and the development and maintenance of female secondary sex characteristics. **Ovarian progesterone** is a steroid hormone, secreted by the corpus luteum of the ovary and abundantly by the placenta, which acts to prepare the endometrium for implantation of the fertilized ovum, to maintain pregnancy, and to promote development of the mammary glands.\[2\] 

**The following outline shows the correspondence between observations of cervical mucus, BBT Shift, and menses in relation to hormonal interplay governing the ovarian cycle.** 

**_On or about the first day of menstrual bleeding:_** The hypothalamus secretes increasing levels of GnRH, which stimulates the pituitary to increase production and release of FSH and LH.

**_From about day 3 to 5 of menstruation to first signs of non-peak cervical mucus:_** FSH and LH stimulate follicle growth and maturation. FSH exerts its main influence on the follicles cells.\[3\] LH targets the thecal cells. The growing follicle releases estrogen. LH causes the thecal cells to produce androgens \[4\], which disperse through the basal membrane. The FSH-affected granulosa cells then convert them to estrogens, which are released into the blood.

**_From the first signs of non-peak cervical mucus to the appearance of peak type cervical mucus:_** The rising blood level of estrogen creates a general **negative feedback** on the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. This negative feedback specifically causes the anterior pituitary to inhibit FSH and LH release, while simultaneously synthesizing and storing FSH and LH. In the ovary, rising estrogen levels intensify the effect of FSH on the maturing follicle. In addition, the granulosa cells release **inhibin**, which exerts a negative feedback on FSH release.

**_From the appearance of peak type cervical mucus to “peak day” to a rise in BBT (indicative of an ovulatory event):_** As described above, initially the rise in estrogen blood levels causes the inhibition of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. However, eventually estrogen blood levels reach a critical point that exerts the opposite effect, which is a **positive feedback** on the brain and anterior pituitary. This critical high level of blood estrogen creates a cascade of events that occurs over only a few days. The anterior pituitary releases a small amount of FSH and a large **surge of LH**, which stimulates the primary oocyte of the dominant follicle to complete the first meiotic division thereby completing its transformation into become the secondary oocyte, which continues its development to metaphase II. The **LH surge triggers ovulation** about 24 hours of it reaching critical levels **\[4a\].** LH induces the synthesis of proteolytic enzymes that stop blood flow through the protruding part of the follicle wall. Within minutes this causes the follicle wall to visibly distend, thin and ooze fluid before abruptly rupturing.

**_From ovulation to menstruation (the beginning of a new ovarian cycle):_** Estrogen levels decline sharply after ovulation. The LH surge transforms the ruptured follicle into a **corpus luteum** and stimulates it to immediately produce progesterone and estrogen, with a preponderance of progesterone. Rising levels of estrogen and progesterone exert a **negative feedback** on the anterior pituitary, inhibiting release of LH and FSH. As gonadotropin levels decline, the development of new follicles is inhibited. This prevents more than one ovulation from occurring. As LH blood levels decline about 8 to 10 days after ovulation, corpus luteum activity declines, and the corpus luteum begins degenerating. The life of the corpus luteum is from 12 to 16 days, average 14 days. As the corpus luteum degenerates estrogen and progesterone levels decline sharply. The sharp decline in ovarian hormones stimulates the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary to again release FSH and LH. A new ovarian cycle begins on or about the first day of menstrual bleeding.\[5\]

When **fertilization** takes place, even before the resulting **zygote** implants in the endometrium, the trophoblast cells of its blastocyst \[6\] produce and release **human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)**. HCG is similar to LH in function and structure, and signals the corpus luteum to continue producing progesterone. **The presence of hCG assures that the corpus luteum does not degenerate.** With the continuing production of progesterone, the beginning of a new ovarian cycle is suspended, and menstruation does not take place.

## 2.4 - The Menstrual Cycle {.unnumbered}

### Required Reading {.unnumbered}

Refer to page 8 in _Justisse Method for Fertility Management: A User's Guide_. Geraldine Matus. 2009.

### The Endometrial (Uterine/Menstrual) Cycle {.unnumbered}

Specifically, the **menstrual cycle** refers to a cycle of events associated with the development, maintenance, degeneration, and shedding of the uterine endometrium. The menstrual cycle has three distinct phases: 1) **menstrual phase**, the shedding of the endometrium 2) **proliferative phase**, the restoration of the endometrium after menstruation 3) **secretory phase**, the specialized development of the endometrium that allows for implantation. The hormonal feedback interactions that govern the ovarian cycle, correspondingly govern the endometrial cycle. The menstrual and proliferative phases of the menstrual cycle overlap the follicular and ovulation stages in the ovarian cycle. The menstrual secretory phase corresponds to the ovarian luteal phase.
![[C2.4-endometrial-cycle.png]][link to image](https://justisse.ca/MediaGallery/HRHP%20Images/HRHP/UnitC/uterine_cycle1336082215118.jpg)

### Menstrual Phase {.unnumbered}

Technically, the menstrual phase begins 1 to 3 days before the onset of menstrual bleeding. The previously fully mature endometrium becomes **ischemic** \[1\] concurrent with corpus luteum degeneration. The spiral arteries begin to kink and go into spasms, that is, become ischemic. The circulation in the endometrium decreases and shrinkage due to loss of tissue fluids and secretions takes place. Without oxygen or nutrients, endometrial cells die, and their **lysosomes** \[2\] rupture causing the functional layer of the endometrium to 'self digest.' There is a period of alternating vasoconstriction and vasodilation. Then the spiral arteries constrict one last time before suddenly relaxing and opening wide. This releases blood into the weakened capillary beds causing them to fragment, and the thick functional layer of the endometrium to shed from the uterine wall. The endometrial shed and bleeding from the vessels are what constitute **menstrum** (menstrual flow). Bleeding and endometrial tissue loss continues from 4 to 7 days until the endometrium has shed to all but its basal cell layer and the vessels have sealed themselves. The menstrum leaves the body through the vagina.

At the beginning of this phase, gonadotropin and ovarian hormones are at their lowest normal levels. By day 3 to 5 of menstruation, FSH levels begin to rise, stimulating ovarian follicles to produce estrogen, which will exert influence in endometrial restoration.

### Proliferative Phase {.unnumbered}

After menstruation, under the influence of rising estrogen levels from developing follicles, the basal cell layer of the endometrium **proliferates** (rapidly generates) a new functional layer. At the beginning of the proliferative phase, the endometrial mucosa is 1-4 mm thick and its glands are short, straight, and narrow. As the new layer thickens, its glands enlarge and the number of spiral arteries increase. At the end of the phase, when ovulation is imminent, the endometrial mucosa is 5-9 mm thick and well vascularized. During this phase, estrogen induces the synthesis of progesterone receptors in the endometrial cells, preparing them for the secretory phase. **Ovulation** occurs in the ovary at the end of this stage in response the LH surge.

The lower portion of the uterus, the cervix, undergoes significant changes that follow a cyclical pattern, and corresponds with the ovarian and menstrual cycles. For the details about the cycle of cervical mucus changes see “Nature's Gate: The cycle of cervical mucus changes” below. Notably, cervical mucus is noticeable at the vulva from about 2 to 7 days during the proliferative phase, in order to facilitate sperm survival in anticipation of imminent ovulation.

### Secretory Phase {.unnumbered}

The secretory phase begins after ovulation and coincides with the development of the **corpus luteum**. A normal secretory phase lasts from **10 to 16 days, on average 13**, which is the life of the corpus luteum when fertilization does not take place. The uterus is receptive to implantation for only a few days each menstrual cycle. These days occur during the secretory phase, and correspond with the exact time that the developing embryo would seek implantation, about **8 to 10 days following ovulation**. The **purpose of this phase is to prepare the endometrium for implantation.** See **[Unit C Section 2.7 Fertilization](https://justisse.ca/index.php/college/courseware/page/1059).**

Under the influence of rising levels of progesterone produced by the corpus luteum, the estrogen-primed endometrium undergoes several changes. Vascularity increases and the spiral arteries elaborate and coil more tightly. As well, the functional area of the endometrium converts to a secretory mucosa as endometrial glands enlarge, becoming longer, wider, and tortuous (convoluted and twisted). They begin to secrete nutritious glycoproteins into the uterine cavity. **Glycoproteins** sustain the embryo until it has implanted in the well-vascularized endometrial lining. The **stroma** (connective tissue framework) increases and becomes **edematous** (serous fluid filled). In the middle to end of the luteal phase, the endometrium should be 7-12 mm thick for implantation to be possible. This heavily vascular, softly edematous, and glycogen-rich endometrium is ready for embryo implantation and nourishment.

During the secretory phase, cervical mucus is no longer noticeable at the vulva. For the details about the cycle of cervical mucus changes see “Nature's Gate: The cycle of cervical mucus changes” below.

Rising levels of progesterone and estrogen inhibit LH release by the anterior pituitary. If fertilization does not occur, the corpus luteum begins to degenerate as LH levels decline near the end of the secretory phase, that is, about days 8 to 10 following ovulation, unless conception has occurred. As the corpus luteum degenerates there is a decrease in progesterone and estrogen levels, which deprives the endometrium of its hormonal support. This leads to menstruation - see “The Menstrual Phase” above.

If pregnancy occurs, endometrial development continues under the influence of progesterone produced by the corpus luteum, and become even thicker tissue and is termed **decidua of pregnancy**. When a fertilized ovum implants in the endometrium, progesterone maintains the pregnancy by continuing to support the endometrium in a secretory state. It also reduces the contractions that normally occur in the uterine muscle, thereby allowing the fertilized ovum to implant and develop, protected against expulsion.

## 2.5 - Cycle of Cervical Mucus Changes {.unnumbered}

### Required Reading {.unnumbered}

Refer to pages 10, 22-26 in _Justisse Method for Fertility Management: A User's Guide_. Geraldine Matus. 2009.

### Nature's Gate: Cycle of Cervical Mucus Changes {.unnumbered}

Contained within the cervix, the narrow lower neck of the uterus that joins the vagina is the **endocervical canal**, which opens into the vagina via the external os (mouth) and the body of the uterus via the internal os. The mucosa of the endocervical canal is a single layer of cells made of **ciliated epithelium** and mucus secreting glands called **cervical crypts**. There is about **one ciliated cell for every 20 secretory cells.** The cervical crypts respond to estrogen and progesterone stimulation and the mucus they produce changes according to which hormone is dominant. The mucus produced by the cervical crypts acts as **Nature's Gate,** allowing or disallowing the entry of sperm.

The **ciliated cells** have a “hair-like” border at the top called cilia, which move in synchronization toward the vagina. Primarily, the role of ciliated cells is to move mucus out of the cervix into the vagina, and remain uninfluenced by estrogen or progesterone.

The **cervical crypts** secrete mucus that changes in quality and quantity in response to estrogen and progesterone stimulation.

**After menstruation**, when estrogen and progesterone levels are low, the cervical crypts produce a viscous (thick, sticky), opaque mucus that creates a mucilaginous plug in the endocervical canal (dry days of the cycle) known as the **cervical plug**. [

### Cervical Mucus During the Proliferative Phase {.unnumbered}

During the proliferative phase, as estrogen levels rise cervical mucus secretions increases in quantity and change quality, becoming thinner, more lubricious \[1\], and transparent. The peak production of this type of mucus occurs just before ovulation. This **estrogenic** or **E-type cervical mucus** forms widely spaced, parallel channels called **micelles** designed to facilitate sperm transport through the uterus into the fallopian tubes where fertilization takes place. The **alkalinity (pH 8.5)** of E-type mucus makes it particularly hospitable to sperm.![[C2.5-natures-gate.png]][link to image](https://justisse.ca/MediaGallery/HRHP%20Images/HRHP/UnitC/Nature%27s%20Gate.jpg)

A normal vaginal pH level is between 3.8 and 4.5, which is moderately acidic. 

The presence of E-type mucus in the vaginal canal reduces vaginal acidity, which increases the survival time of the sperm. It is generally accepted that in the presence of E-type mucus sperm may survive from 3 to 4 days, and that in the absence of E-type mucus sperm survive may survive a few minutes to a few hours **\[3,4\].** The oft-quoted 5 or up to 7 days of sperm survival would be the rare exception rather than the rule.

E-type mucus has the peculiar capacity to filter out sperm with abnormal morphology and prevent them from penetrating the cervix. Of the approximately 500 to 50 million sperm present in a normal ejaculate only 100 to 20 thousand will actually ever reach the inner recesses of the uterus and fallopian tubes. E-type mucus also contains nutritive factors (sugars and protein) and **prostaglandins**.\[2\] Prostaglandins assist sperm transport by stimulating the reproductive tract to rhythmically contract and move the sperm into the uterus and fallopian tubes. (Semen also contains prostaglandins.) **E-type mucus is vital to sperm survival and capacitation.** 

-   Ovulation occurs on only one day in each cycle.
-   An egg lives only 12 to 24 hours.
-   Sperm need E-type mucus to survive.
-   Sperm may survive 3-4 days in E-type mucus.
-   Sperm will die within hours or minutes when not in E-type mucus.
-   The female and male together are only fertile for 6 days.

There are various names that refer to E-type mucus: **spinnbarkheit**, peak mucus, peak type mucus, fertile mucus, fertile fluid, peak fluid, and wet, among others. Spinnbarkheit is a German term that refers specifically to the ability of E-type mucus to stretch into long thin threads.

E-type cervical mucus contains about 92 to 95 per cent water, which makes it a **hydrogel** and accounts for its character. At about the same time as high estrogen levels trigger the LH surge, the mucus may be as much as 98 per cent water. When estrogen levels are high. the cervical crypts produce an abundance of mucus, from 70 to 500 cc per day of E-type mucus. This is why E-type of mucus is easily noticed at the vulva, and has been variously described as slippery, wet, lubricious, thin, stretchy, thready, cloudy, clear, tacky, lubricative, watery, slick, glistening, stretchy-spinnbarkheit effect, or egg white-like (wet or fertile days of the cycle). The structure of fertile mucus observed using nuclear magnetic resonance demonstrates a diverse network that aids sperm penetration.

The fundamental principles for the meaningful observation of cervical mucus have been known to health care providers for many years and are well documented. Cohen, Stein and Kaye published a schemata of the events that occur relative to the changes in the cervical mucus as ovulation approaches (1952.)**\[3\]**. Their schemata came to define the basic principles of what was to become first the Billings Ovulation Method and later other FAM/NFP methodologies. Figure 1 shows Cohen's original schemata for cervical mucus patterns around the time of ovulation. Note the depiction of the sperm survival in relation to spinnbarkheit characteristic; a de facto recognition of the role of the cervical mucus as a biological valve (Nature's Gate). 

It is now clearly established and accepted that the production of cervical mucus around the time of the development of the follicle and approaching ovulation is an estrogen-dependent effect, and that the closer ovulation approaches, the more cervical mucus increases in clarity, stretchiness, and quantity.  Contrarily, its viscosity and leukocyte (white blood cell) content decreases at that time.  The recognition of the quality of lubriciousness associated with cervical mucus followed Cohen's work. The most important observation Cohen made was that sperm survival is directly related to the presence or the absence of an ovulatory or preovulatory type of mucus produced from the cervix;  what Justisse refers to as E-type cervical mucus.

### A NOTE ON THE SPERM SURVIVAL CONTROVERSY {.unnumbered}

The methodology of research regarding sperm survival is both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro research means that the media for sperm survival is not the reproductive track of a female, rather a cellular matrix imbued with cervical mucus and sperm. In vivo research uses the female body as the object of study.  [Billings Ovulation Method (BOM)](https://web.archive.org/web/20051226124346/http://www.woomb.org:80/bom/science/ovarian.html) studies have found sperm survival to be limited to 5 days, with no evidence to support longer longevity [(Knaus, Ogino)](https://web.archive.org/web/20070221081848/http://www.woomb.org:80/omrrca/bulletin/vol29/no1/TheQuest.pdf). An Australian summary of BOM study states that:

> _Indications were that sperm survival in one case was 5-6 days, 6-7 in two cases and 7-8 on one other. A sperm survival time of up to five days is credible in the presence of adequate amounts of fertile mucus, but present scientific knowledge does not allow a clear statement about sperm viability for longer than this. (Boyer, et. al. 1970 ) **\[1\]**_

Sperm access the female reproductive tract by means of E-type cervical mucus present in the vaginal and cervical canals. Once sperm gain access to the fallopian tube and attach to the tube wall the presence or absence of E-type mucus is a moot point. E-type mucus is critical for sperm capacitation and its early survival in the female reproductive tract. In the presence of E-type mucus, after ejaculation in the vagina, sperm may access the fallopian tubes within a few minutes to a few hours. Some sperm may remain in the cervical crypts for several days and may attempt to access the fallopian tubes, though over time the chance of their survival diminishes. Though one cannot correctly assume that the sperm that remain in the endocervical canal are a reservoir of sperm. So ultimately sperm survival depends not only on E-type mucus but on how safely sperm attach to the epithelial tissue of the fallopian tube \[2\].

Because sperm access the fallopian tubes relatively quickly when bathed in E-type mucus, post-coital examination of the vaginal and cervical canal to determine sperm survival has limitations of accuracy. BOM studies have included washing the reproductive tract and examining the fluid for sperm, and using in vitro fallopian tube tissue to determine sperm life and motility. Much FABM literature describes very complex interactions of sperm within the female reproductive track in overly simplified ways.

According to sperm physiologist [Joanna Ellington PhD](https://www.smashwords.com/profile/view/gdclifton), sperm in the presence of E-type mucus penetrate into the endocervical canal within 1.5 min and have gained access to the fallopian tubes within 30 minutes, and with no gain in sperm numbers in the fallopian tubes after 45 min from intercourse. She claims that the "cervical reservoir" of sperm is not an actual pool of fertilizing sperm. Sperm from some males has almost no sperm attaching to the fallopian tubes and their sperm die quickly within hours, while other males have a high attachment and survival rate with sperm living attached to the tubal cells for up to 9 days in invitro testing. **\[4\]**

### Cervical Mucus During the Secretory Phase {.unnumbered}

During the secretory phase, high levels of progesterone have an inhibitory effect on the cervical crypts, interfering with their response to estrogen and therefore the secretion of estrogenic or E-type mucus. The mucus during this time is not easily noticeable at the vulva, and for the most part remains as a thick, gelatinous plug in the endocervical canal, is referred to as **gestagenic** or **G-Type cervical mucus (mucus)**. The structure of G-Type mucus is a dense, mesh-like network, which sperm _cannot_ easily penetrate. The pH of G-Type mucus is acidic, and therefore hostile to sperm. When progesterone levels are high or estrogen levels are low, the cervical crypts produce from .2 to .6 cc per day of G-Type mucus. It produces only enough to maintain a cervical plug in the endocervical canal.

During the secretory phase, no E-Type cervical mucus is noticeable at the vulva, noticing instead a sensation of dryness (dry days of the cycle). The G-Type mucus loses water content, which accounts for its greater viscosity compared to E-type mucus.

**The amount and quality of cervical mucus secretion is a function of:**

-   The number of cervical crypts in the endocervical canal
-   The responsiveness of secretory cells to circulating hormones![Cervical Mucus Variations](https://justisse.ca/MediaGallery/HRHP%20Images/HRHP/UnitJ/Cervical%20Mucus%20Ferning%20Odeblad.jpg)

-   Health of the cervical crypts
-   Health of a female's endocrine system

Most cervical crypts, in response to circulating hormones, can alternate their function to produce either E-type mucus or Type G mucus. The crypts that cannot alternate their function are called **Iso-secretory units** or, more specifically, **Iso-E-units** and **Iso-G-units**. 

### E-type and G-Type Cervical Mucus Under the Microscope {.unnumbered}

The effects of estrogen and progesterone on the cervical mucus can be seen under a microscope. The cervical mucus sample should be placed on a glass slide, covered with a thin, glass cover slip and allowed to dry at room temperature for 48 hours. E-type mucus has a channel-like construction formed from micelles, and appears under the microscope in a characteristic fern like pattern or **ferning**. The fern pattern is created by the formation of crystals that develop due to high concentrations of sodium and potassium salts (NaCl, KCl, and KBr) present in E-type mucus (L and S in microscopic view to the right). G-Type mucus has the appearance of compactly segmented stained glass, and sperm cannot move through it. ![[C2.5-cervical-fluid-variations.png]][link to image](https://justisse.ca/MediaGallery/HRHP%20Images/HRHP/UnitJ/Cervical%20Mucus%20Ferning%20Odeblad.jpg)

In summary, the most important function of the cervical mucus is its role as **Nature's Gate**. When the gate is open, E-type mucus predominates, and sperm can penetrate the cervix, await ovulation, and make the journey to the fallopian tubes where fertilization is attempted. When G-Type mucus predominates the gate is closed, and the cervical plug acts as a mechanical barrier, preventing sperm and other undesirable organisms from entering the uterine cavity, and thus the peritoneal cavity. The key to understand the current state of fertility is understanding when the gate is closed and when it is open, which is why the **detection and observation of cervical mucus is critical in determining fertility**.

### Changes in the Position & Texture of the Cervix (Cephalad Shift) {.unnumbered}

___

**_Refer to pages 12, 22-23 in Required Text_ _Justisse Method for Fertility Management: A User's Guide__. Geraldine Matus. 2009._**

 **_NOTE:_**

In the JM User's Guide please note that on page 12 the cervical positions that are addressed are open/closed, tilted/straight, and firm/soft. The high/low position is not included in the JM literature though it is commonly included in other FABM literature. On page 23 of the guide there is a clarification of why the high/low position is not included. The JM User's Guide says:

"Some women feel the alignment with the rectum and the cervical opening as a sense that the cervix is _high_ and hard to reach or _low_ and easy to reach. These different experiences are related to how an individual's reproductive organs are arranged in the pelvic cavity."

One must consider that:

-   the high/low factor is governed by changing levels of the hormone [relaxin](https://justisse.ca/index.php/college/courseware/page/1072) in response to sex steroids
-   the physical fitness of the pelvic floor (muscles, ligaments, fascia) will influence how the uterus (fundus and cervix) is placed in the pelvic cavity
-   obesity will increase the fatty pads in the viscera and can shift the normal placement of organs in the pelvic cavity
-   mineral status in the body affects the health of muscles, ligaments and fascia

The approach for using cervical position as a factor for determining fertility and infertility is to have the person record observations and compare one day to the next (essential sameness, relative differences) rather than the experience of others. What are the relative changes -- how is today like or not like yesterday. the decades of clinical experience of Justisse founder, Geraldine Matus, correlates with the previous statement.

The research regarding cervical position is sketchy and in experience shows that having a person focus on their own experience of the relative changes is the most reliable system. Also cervical position is best used in conjunction with mucus observations, though often after charting cervical position for many cycles a person may come to find it a reliable system even on its own.

Edward Keefe on the cephalad shift: [Keefe Cephalad Shift](https://justisse.ca/MediaGallery/HRHP%20Documents/HRHP/UnitC/Cephalad_Shift_of_the_Cervix_Uteri.pdf) The study group was small. This research has not yet been replicated by others.

___

 During the proliferative phase, under the influence of estrogen, the cervix changes in the following ways:

-   Ligaments supporting the uterus relax and soften under the influence of increased levels of the hormone **relaxin** (see [Unit C Section 4.6 “Relaxin Hormone](https://justisse.ca/index.php/college/courseware/page/1072)”)
-   The external os begins to **open** slightly to allow cervical mucus to pass
![[C2.5-cervical-exam.png]][link to image](https://justisse.ca/MediaGallery/HRHP%20Images/HRHP/UnitF/Cervical%20Exam.jpg)
The texture of the cervix becomes **soft** like the texture of the lower lip

-   The cervix shifts position so that its external os is **straight** in alignment with the angle of the vaginal canal
-   Tucks **high** up in the vaginal canal often making it difficult to reach during manual examination.

As ovulation approaches the above changes become more pronounced:

During the secretory phase, following ovulation, under the influence of progesterone, the cervix quickly makes the following changes:

-   Declining levels of **Relaxin** cause the cervix to "harden"
-   The external os becomes **closed**
-   The cervix feels **firm** like the tip of the nose
-   The position of its external os is **tilted** toward the rectum
-   The cervix shifts **lower** into the vaginal canal making it easy to reach during manual examination.

During the menstrual phase, the cervix opens slightly to allow the menstrum through, but its texture and position remains the same as that of the secretory phase.

## 2.6 - Female Reproductive Cycle and BBT Changes & Shift {.unnumbered}

### Basal Metabolic Rate & Basal Body Temperature {.unnumbered}

The term **metabolic rate** refers to the body's rate of energy output (usually expressed per hour). The energy output includes the total heat produced by all the chemical reactions and mechanical work of the body. **Basal metabolic rate (BMR)** refers to the measurement of metabolic rate under a standardized laboratory condition, and is meant to reflect the energy the body requires for involuntary physiological function. The lowest metabolic state occurs during sleep. Generally, the younger a person is the higher their BMR. BMR declines dramatically in the elderly. Males generally have a higher BMR than females, due to their comparatively higher levels of testosterone.

BMR rises and falls with the **basal body temperature** (BBT). **Stress**, emotional or physical, causes the adrenal gland to release **norepinephrine** \[1\] and **epinephrine** \[2\] into the bloodstream, thereby mobilizing the sympathetic nervous system. The mobilization of the sympathetic nervous system primarily stimulates fat catabolism (metabolic breakdown), which is responsible for the rise in BMR and BBT. However, **thyroxine (T4) and triiodothryonine (T3)** are the most important hormonal influences in determining BMR and BBT.

**T3 and T4 are primarily responsible for regulation of cellular metabolism, which is the basal metabolic rate** 

Tyrosine (an amino acid) based hormones [triiodothyronine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triiodothyronine "Triiodothyronine") (**T3**) and its prohormone, [thyroxine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroxine "Thyroxine") (**T4**) are produced by the thyroid gland. T4 is also produced in other body tissues peripheral to the thyroid gland. T4 is converted as required in the tissues by **iodothyronine deiodinase**. Deficiency of deiodinase can mimic an iodine deficiency, and iodine deficiency can limit the production of thyroid hormones.  All three isoforms of deiodinase contain selenium. Both T3 and T4 molecules contain iodine. A deficiency of iodine leads to decreased production of T3 and T4 and can cause the development of a goiter (enlarged thyroid gland). Thus adequate dietary or supplementary intake of tyrosine, iodine, and selenium are essential for thyroid hormone production.
![[C2.6-bbt-ovulation.png]][link to image](https://justisse.ca/MediaGallery/HRHP%20Images/HRHP/UnitC/bbt_ovulation.gif)

**T3 and T4** directly affect all body cells and are responsible for regulation of cellular metabolism, growth, oxygen consumption (cellular respiration), use of ATP \[3\] for sodium-potassium regulation, and cellular respiration. The more thyroid hormone that is produced and utilized the higher the BMR and BBT. Before the development of blood tests for thyroid function, BMR and BBT tests were used to measure the sufficiency of the thyroid gland to produce adequate amounts of thyroxin. (See your required text _Solved: the Riddle of Illness_ by Stephen Langer.)

The **hypothalamus** works with the thyroid gland in the regulation of BBT. (It is important to note that the hypothalamic-pituitary-target endocrine organ feedback loop is at the core of all endocrine function.) When the BBT falls below normal the hypothalamus releases **thyrotropin-releasing hormone**, which activates the anterior pituitary to release **thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)**. TSH induces the thyroid gland to release larger amount of the thyroid hormones thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) into the blood stream. The hypothalamus is also similarly stimulated by the release of norepinephrine and epinephrine in response to stress.  

___

\[1\] Norepinephrine (noradrenaline) - a hormone and neurotransmitter, secreted by the adrenal medulla and the nerve endings of the sympathetic nervous system to cause vasoconstriction and increases in heart rate, blood pressure, and the sugar level of the blood.

\[2\] Epinephrine (adrenaline) - a hormone secreted by the adrenal medulla in response to physical or mental stress, which initiates many bodily responses, including the stimulation of heart action and an increase in blood pressure, metabolic rate, and blood glucose concentration.

\[3\] ATP - and adenosine-derived nucleotide containing high-energy phosphate bonds that is used to transport energy to cells for biochemical processes, including muscle contraction and enzymatic metabolism, through its hydrolysis to ADP. ADP is a nucleotide composed of adenosine and two linked phosphate groups that are converted to ATP for the storage of energy.

___

**Liothyronine** is a synthetic form of T3 (triiodothryonine) and is used to treat hypothyroidism and myxedema coma, and as an augmentation strategy in treating Major Depressive Disorder in combination with antidepressants.It is marketed as the sodium salt under the brand name Cytomel or Tertroxin.

### Fertilization: From a Gamete (egg) to an Embryo {.unnumbered}

The sperm must reach the secondary oocyte that was released during ovulation. **The oocyte is viable for about 12 to 24 hours after the ovary releases it**. Ejaculated sperm bathed continuously by an abundance of Peak-Type cervical mucus may survive from 3 to 4 days. The oft-quoted 5 or up to 7 days of sperm survival would be the rare exception rather than the rule. In the absence of Peak-Type cervical mucus, sperm perish within a few minutes to a few hours**\[3\]**. [(See Unit C Section 2.5)](https://justisse.ca/index.php/college/courseware/page/1491) To optimize the opportunity for fertilization, sexual intercourse needs to take place when Peak-Type cervical mucus is present and within a range of five days or less before ovulation and 24 hours after ovulation. By 24 hours post ovulation the action of the fallopian tube (peristalsis and cilia) has brought the oocyte down about 1/3 of its length. It is at that point the sperm meet the oocyte if conditions favor it.

**Fertilization** occurs when a sperm and oocyte fuse and combine genetic material to form a fertilized ovum, or **zygote** (“yoked together”), the first cell of what may develop into the fetus. There are several important events that must occur before fertilization is possible, which are discussed in [Unit C Section 3.3 "Accomplishing Fertilization"](https://justisse.ca/index.php/college/courseware/page/1064). See images below.

#### Completion of Meiosis II & Fertilization {.unnumbered}

After a sperm enters the oocyte, it “unpacks” its 23 chromosomes in the peripheral cytoplasm before migrating to the center of the oocyte. The secondary oocyte, activated by an ionic calcium signal, completes **meiosis II** to form the ovum nucleus and ejects the second polar body. The ovum and sperm nuclei enlarge and become the **female** and **male pronuclei**, and approach each other as a mitotic spindle develops between them. The pronuclei membranes then rupture, releasing their chromosomes into the vicinity of the spindle. The moment of **fertilization** occurs at this point when the maternal and paternal chromosomes combine and produce the diploid zygote, which now has a pair of each type of chromosome. The **zygote** is the cell formed by the union of the genetic material of a sperm and oocyte, and maintains the name of zygote until it completes cleavage. See image “ Ovum and Polar Body” below.

### Preembryonic Development {.unnumbered}

![[C2.7-ovum.png]][link to image](https://justisse.ca/MediaGallery/HRHP%20Images/HRHP/UnitC/UnitC-OvumAndPolarBodySurroundedByZonaPellucida.gif)
**Preembryonic development** is the time from fertilization to implantation. After fertilization, the **zygote** undergoes a period of rapid mitotic divisions, called **cleavage**. From between the **36th and 72nd hours after fertilization** the first cleavage division of the zygote produces two identical cells called **blastomers**, which divide to produce 4, then 8, then 16 cells, and so on. The resulting berry-shaped cell cluster of 16 or more cells is called a **morula**. While this is happening, the zygote journeys along the fallopian tubes towards the uterus. Cleavage occurs so rapidly that the daughter cells have little time to grow. This creates an advantage, as the high surface-to-volume ratio of these cells optimizes the uptake of oxygen and nutrients, and waste disposal. The daughter cells produced during cleavage are the building blocks of the embryo. The zygote is designated an **embryo** once cleavage is complete.

![[C2.7-segmentation-of-ovum.png]][link to image](https://justisse.ca/MediaGallery/HRHP%20Images/HRHP/UnitC/UnitC-FirstStagesOfSegmentationOfOvum.jpg)

The image to the left shows first stages of segmentation of ovum.

 By the **4th or 5th day after fertilization**, the **embryo** (about 100 cells large) reaches the uterine cavity where it free-floats for 2 or 3 days before implantation, receiving nutrients from the uterine secretions. Here the zona pellucida breaks down, releasing the blastocyst. The **blastocyst**, produced during the cleavage process, is a fluid-filled hollow sphere and a small cluster of rounded cells on one side (**inner cell mass**) both of which are enclosed by a single layer of large, flattened cells called **trophoblast cells (trophoderm)**. The role of the trophoblast cells is to attach the blastocyst to the endometrium, serve as a nutritive pathway for the embryo, and initiate placental development.

___

### Implantation {.unnumbered}

**Implantation begins** about the **6th or 8th day after fertilization**, which corresponds more or less with the 6th or 8th day following ovulation depending on the exact moment the sperm fertilizes the oocyte within its 12 to 24 hour life span. The trophoblast monitors for chemical signals that demonstrate the blood levels of estrogen and progesterone in the endometrium are at the critical level for the **window of implantation**, and then attaches the blastocyst to the endometrium. The trophoblast cells overlying the inner cell mass adhere to the endometrium and begin to secrete digestive enzymes, cytokines \[1\], and growth factors onto the endometrial surface. At the point of adhesion, the endometrium thickens and develops an acute inflammatory response. The uterine blood vessels become permeable and leaky, inflammatory cells (e.g. lymphocytes and macrophages) invade the site. The trophoblast cells then divide, forming an inner layer of **cytotrophoblast cells** that retain their cell boundaries, and an outer layer of **syncytiotrophoblast cells** that project into the endometrium and rapidly erode the endometrium cells they contact. The blastocyst burrows into the eroded endometrium and becomes surrounded by a pool of blood formed from the leakage of degraded endometrial vessels. The endometrial cells then proliferate and cover over the blastocyst. The **total process of implantation takes about 7 days**, making the total time period from fertilization to the completion of implantation at about 13 to 15 days, which corresponds with the lifespan of the corpus luteum, and the time when menses would begin if fertilization had not taken place.

The LH-like hormone, **human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) secreted by the trophoblast cells** of the blastocyst ensures the viability of the corpus luteum.\[2\] HCG circumvents the pituitary-ovarian hormonal feedback and stimulates the corpus luteum to continue secreting progesterone and estrogen. The **chorion** that develops from the trophoblast after implantation continues this hormonal stimulation. In this way, the embryo controls hormonal stimulation of the uterus and the viability of the pregnancy.

HCG blood levels rise for the first 8 weeks of gestation and decline sharply at about 16 weeks, maintaining that level for the remainder of the pregnancy. Between 8 and 12 weeks gestation the placenta assumes the role of the corpus luteum, producing progesterone and estrogen in sufficient quantities to maintain the pregnancy until term (36 to 38 weeks). The corpus luteum begins to degenerate between 8 and 12 weeks gestation and the ovaries remain inactive until after birth.

During the first 8 weeks of gestation, the implanted embryo digests endometrial cells for its nourishment. By the end of the first 8 weeks the placenta is developed enough to provide nutrients and oxygen to the embryo, and to dispose of metabolic wastes.

#### Implantation and Immune Function: Miscarriage and autoimmune thyroid disease {.unnumbered}

Human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) is released within hours of fertilization and has a profound ability to downregulate maternal cellular immunity against trophoblastic paternal antigens. It also promotes angiogenic activity of the extravillous trophoblast, and impairment of this function may lead to inadequate placentation and an increased risk of preeclampsia.

There is increasing evidence that hCG alters the activity of dendritic cells via an upregulation of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase activity. This reduces T-cell activation and cytokine production, as well as encouraging Treg cell recruitment to the fetal-maternal interface. These changes are critical in promoting maternal tolerance. hCG is also able to increase the proliferation of uterine natural killer cells, while reducing the activity of cytotoxic peripheral blood natural killer cells.

There are rare reports of autoantibodies directed against hCG or the luteinizing hormone/hCG receptor in females recurrently miscarrying. These autoantibodies are more frequent in those with thyroid autoimmunity, or other thyroid dysfunction This may explain the association between thyroid autoimmunity and impaired fertility. Downregulating these anti-hCG and anti-luteinizing hormone/hCG receptor autoantibodies may be helpful in those who experienced early miscarriage or recurrent failed in vitro fertilization.

### **A Summary of the Hormonal Regulation of the Female Reproductive Cycle**

1.  GnRH from the hypothalamus stimulates the pituitary to produce FSH.
2.  During the early pre-ovulatory phase, the pituitary secretes low levels of FSH.
3.  FSH stimulates growth and maturation of a follicle.
4.  As the follicle grows and matures, it secretes estrogen in increasing amounts.
5.  Rising levels of estrogen exert negative feedback on the pituitary to gradually lower FSH levels.
6.  Estrogen, at high enough levels, exerts a positive feedback effect on the hypothalamus.
7.  The hypothalamus stimulates the pituitary to secrete a surge of LH.
8.  The effect of the LH surge causes the mature follicle to rupture, release the egg, and start to form a corpus luteum.
9.  After ovulation, LH stimulates the corpus luteum to secrete progesterone and estrogen to prepare the uterus for implantation.
10.  Rising levels of the estrogen-progesterone a negative feedback effect on the hypothalamus and pituitary, causing levels of LH to decrease.
11.  As LH decreases, the corpus luteum starts to degenerate.
12.  Unless an embryo has implanted, near the end of the post-ovulatory phase, without the stimulation of LH, the corpus luteum stops producing estrogen and progesterone. Thus the endometrium is no longer maintained and begins to deteriorate and sheds.
13.  During menses estrogen, progesterone, LH, and FSH are at their lowest levels.
14.  Low estrogen and progesterone levels stimulate the hypothalamus to secrete GnRH - a new cycle begins.
15.  If an egg was fertilized, it divides as it travels down the Fallopian tube, and the **blastocyst** that reaches the uterus is about 100 cells in size and ready to implant in the endometrium.
16.  If implantation is successful, the outer embryonic membrane, the **chorion** secretes **human chorionic gonadotropin** (HCG) that maintains the corpus luteum during the first trimester of pregnancy. Excess HCG is excreted in the urine, thus many pregnancy tests test for the presence of HCG in urine.
17.  During the second trimester, the placenta starts to secrete progesterone and stops HCG production. Because of the lack of HCG, the corpus luteum, for which the placenta now takes over, is no longer needed and thus degenerates. Hormones secreted by the placenta maintain the endometrium and the pregnancy.

### Required Reading {.unnumbered}

### Perimenopause (Climacteric) and Menopause (See also Unit G) {.unnumbered}

Aging is the progressive deterioration of cells, tissues, and organs associated with increased chronological age. The biological processes associated with certain diseases will accelerate the aging process. The climacteric and menopause are part of the aging process. The rapidity and degree to which a woman experiences the changes associated with the climacteric and menopause depend on her individual biochemistry and her chronological age. The biochemistry of the climacteric and menopause plays a role in degenerative conditions associated with aging; including cardiac disease, cancer, osteoporosis, arthropathy (joint disease), diabetes, dementia, and autoimmune diseases. The climacteric and menopause occur spontaneously. However, surgery (hysterectomy and oophorectomy \[1\]), hormonal intervention, radiation, chemotherapy, and other diseases processes may induce menopause.

#### Perimenopause (Climacteric) {.unnumbered}

The **climacteric (perimenopause)** is a female reproductive phase characterized by physiological and psychoneurological changes that indicate a declining reproductive capacity of women and terminates with the completion of menopause. The climacteric process begins between the ages of 30 and 45 and the associated physiological changes are gradual, usually taking 5 to 10 years to complete. Note these parameters are subject to a woman's state of health and may be remarkedly different in populations of women who are screened for overall health status.

Initially, during the perimenopausal period, hormone levels subtly deviate from normal. Over time, these levels dramatically deviate from normal and become erratic within any given reproductive cycle and these changes may vary from one cycle to the next. Menstrual cycles become irregular, either shorter or longer, or varying between the two. Menstrual bleeding may last fewer days or more days, and may be lighter or heavier, sometimes with clots or bursts of flow (flooding). Women are still fertile during the climacteric; only less so than before its onset, as not all cycles are ovulatory, less oocytes are viable, and the processes supporting fertilization, implantation, and pregnancy become increasingly compromised.

### Menopause {.unnumbered}

**Menopause** is a female reproductive phase marked by the natural and permanent cessation of menstruation, occurring on average at age fifty, with a normal range of occurrence between the ages of 42 and 56. Menopause is said to have occurred when ovulation and menses cease and a woman has not experienced menstruation for a whole year. The physiological experiences and changes associated with the climacteric intensify during menopause, and in some cases, like the shutdown of the ovaries, find completion.

___

\[1\] Oophorectomy (ovariectomy) - the surgical removal of one or both ovaries. 

___

### Hormonal Modulations {.unnumbered}

The climacteric and menopause are associated with hormonal modulations that occur as ovarian function declines. Most women reach peak reproductive capacity in their late 20s. Beginning in their early 30s, most women experience a gradual decline in ovarian function as the ovaries become increasingly less responsive to gonadotropin stimuli. At about 30 years of age, most women still have about 100,000 oocytes in their ovaries (from the approximately 500,000 they were born with). When they reach about 50 years of age there are less than 10 oocytes left. Remember, that though only one oocyte is ovulated each cycle, every day of a woman's life a few oocytes begin development, and if their process does do not receive proper hormonal support they degenerate and are reabsorbed. For as estrogen production declines, ovarian cycles may be anovulatory, or 2 to 4 oocytes may be ovulated per month, a sign of declining control.![[C2.8-hormones-and-age.png]][link to image](https://justisse.ca/MediaGallery/HRHP%20Images/HRHP/UnitC/UnitC-GenPatternAge-related.jpg)

The pituitary gland functions throughout the climacteric and menopause, even though the ovaries eventually cease functioning. The onset of the climacteric is marked by increased pituitary activity, trying to stimulate ovaries that are beginning to be less responsive to gonadotropin stimulation. Levels of FSH and LH continue to increase until well after menopause.

Starting about age 29 to 30, **FSH** blood levels increase significantly, and continue a gradual increase until about 2 to 3 years after menopause. **FSH** levels decrease 20 to 30 years after menopause. Though FSH levels increase, the ovaries respond less and less to this stimulation.

Starting about age 35 to 40, **LH** blood levels sharply rise, and increase dramatically until about 2 to 3 years after menopause. Some studies suggest that “hot flashes” are related to spontaneous LH surges. **LH** levels decline 20 to 30 years after menopause. Some studies suggest that a high serum FSH to LH ratio (1.9-3.8) is a useful indicator of menopausal status. Elevated FSH and LH levels occur because of declining response from the FSH and LH target cells in the ovaries.

**Estradiol (E2)** levels permanently drop below 30 pg/mL in the perimenopausal period, resulting in an increased estrone/estradiol ratio (>1). The ovaries continue to secrete estrogen for a several years following menopause, though they eventually become non-functional. Production of alternative sources of estrogen continues in **fatty tissue** of the body and in the **adrenal glands**. By the second or third decade after menopause, diminished estrogen secretions cause an increase in active **androgens**, which may cause a woman to develop atypical and heavy hair growth (hirsutism). 

Circulating androgen and estrogen concentrations influence the synthesis of **sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG)**. Estradiol (E2) is the most active estrogen in the female body, and is the primary binding estrogen for SHBG. Normal to high estrogen levels stimulates SHBG production, which binds to androgens making them non-bio-available. This process keeps androgen levels at normal levels for women. As estrogen levels decline in perimenopausal and menopausal women, androgen levels increase. Elevated androgens in perimenopausal and menopausal women cause SHBG synthesis to decrease, making certain androgens more bio-available, particularly **testosterone**. Testosterone helps to maintain libido, orgasmic potential, cardio health, and maintenance of muscle mass and strength. Additionally, **androstenedione** is converted to **estrone**, and supplements the body's loss of the ovarian secretion of estradiol. However, the adrenal glands themselves begin to decline in function with age, and thus overall androgen levels decrease, further inhibiting their compensatory function on behalf of failing ovaries, accounting for several climacteric and menopausal processes that reflect androgen insufficiency.

Women of perimenopausal and menopausal age also experience a decline in thyroid function, particularly **T4** and **TSH**. The decline in thyroid function is related to elevated blood cholesterol and declining HDL levels, which are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.

The female reproductive organs begin to atrophy over time with the lack of hormonal stimulation and support. The endometrium and myometrium thin, as does the vaginal mucosal epithelium. The ovaries atrophy and become primarily composed of the scar tissue that results from follicular development and ovulation or follicular atresia. 

### Common Events During the Climacteric and Menopause {.unnumbered}

The climacteric and menopause usually occurs at a time in a woman's life when she is typically undergoing external changes: children are leaving home; relationships change as significant partners undergo similar mid-life changes; career opportunities change; and she is making adjustments to social and cultural expectations and views regarding women and age. Each woman's experience of climacteric and menopausal changes differs.

There is clear evidence to suggest that the physiological symptoms and health risks associated with the climacteric and menopause are reduced by initiating or maintaining a healthy lifestyle including an optimal diet; regular weight-bearing and aerobic exercises; stress-management; eliminating or reducing use of nicotine, alcohol, and caffeine; the use of nutritive, antioxidant, and endocrine supporting vitamin, mineral, and herbal preparations.

The medicalization of perimenopause and menopause has been in the works since the advent of patentable synthetic female sex hormones, and particularly since the mid-1970s with the introduction of **hormone replacement therapies (HRT)**. Currently, it is a challenge for the perimenopausal and menopausal woman to sort out what is true for them with respect to normal parameters of the changes accompanying the climacteric and menopause, what is treatable or preventable, what treatments or preventions are best, and a host of other reproductive health concerns. There is huge controversy regarding synthetic HRT, and an emerging interest in bio-identical HRT. On these topics, women are as likely to get as many differing opinions as the number of reproductive health care providers she asks. The medical orientation of the provider, holistic, complementary medicine, naturopathic, Chinese medicine, Western medicine, etc, will also influence the opinion she receives. HRT (synthetic or bio-identical) includes the use of estrogens, progesterone, testosterone, DHEA, GH, and melatonin. Certain types of HRT have been shown to reduce many menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes, mood swings, and bone loss. Synthetic HRT is associated with a significant increase in the risk of certain types of cancer, loss of bone density, and cardiovascular disease. Each woman needs her reproductive health care provider to help her become as fully informed as possible when making decisions regarding HRT (synthetic or bio-identical).

[Bioidentical Hormone Society](https://www.menopause.org/publications/clinical-practice-materials/bioidentical-hormone-therapy) is a not for profit society dedicated to evidence based research and clinical experience to determine the safe and efficacious use of bio-identical hormone therapies (BHRT). They have an very large data base and occasionally courses/seminars/conferences. If you are serious about understanding BHRT then please check them out. The students of Bastyr University are hired by the society to collate and search out the data under the direction of a number of BHRT experts including Jonathan V. Wright MD, William Ferril  MD and others.

A gradual decrease in nearly all physiological functions accompanies aging, some of which are due as noted above to perimenopausal and menopausal changes, and is reflected by a decrease in muscle mass and strength, sexual function and activity, cognitive functions, and the feeling of well-being, insulin resistance, osteoporosis, and arteriosclerosis.

## 2.9 - Cervical Mucus (Advanced Understanding) {.unnumbered}

### A Natural History of Cervical Mucus: An Advanced Look at Cervical Mucus and the Anatomy and Physiology of the Cervix {.unnumbered}

### Introduction {.unnumbered}

This section will explore in detail cervical mucus and the anatomy and physiology of the cervix. Since 1851, the Western world (longer by other cultural groups, including the African tribal groups, the Taita, the Kamba and the Luo as well as some Australian Aboriginal tribes[\[1\]](https://justisse.ca/index.php/college/courseware/print_pages#_ftn1) ) it has been known that the quantity and quality of cervical mucus changes as ovulation approaches, becoming similar in texture to raw egg white, it was not until the use of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) that it was possible to determine that there are four main types of mucus as well as various secretions that together form the cervical mucus that women observe as a sign of their fertility. 

When we teach women to observe, chart and interpret their cervical mucus, we teach a simplified version of cervical anatomy and mucus-origin, as this is the clearest and more appropriate presentation of the primary sign of fertility. However, as is more often than not the case, things are decidedly more complex. Understanding the details of cervical anatomy and physiology is essential to understanding how and why the menstrual cycle chart provides a picture of neuroendrocrine and reproductive function.

### The Nature of Mucus {.unnumbered}

**_Cervical Mucus_** is secreted by the goblet cells of the epithelial membranes of the mucous membrane of the cervix. It is a viscous fluid that functions to trap micro-organisms and foreign substances and in the case of fertility, to guide and select sperm. 

**_Mucus contains_**:

1.  mucin molecules
2.  water
3.  chemical and biochemical compounds (sodium chloride, protein chains, enzymes).

Mucin is a highly glycolsilated peptide (protein) that is released from cells using vesicles. As it is released, the mucin molecules exchange calcium ions for sodium ions, resulting in their expansion up to 600 times, creating a viscoelastic substance of interwoven molecules called mucus. 

Mucus is able to join together to make polymers or a gel. The mucin component of mucus contains glycoproteins, changing the properties of mucus in many different ways, including its ability to hold water. 

Cervical mucus has been observed to contain granules, which most likely contain enzymes secreted by the isthmus of the cervix, designed to aid in mucolytic action. These granules are called Z secretions, and are believed to aid in sperm capacitation.

Mucus also contains “non-ciliated epithelial cells without the presence of leukocytes or lymphocytes” which may be the stem cells from which L, G, S and P secretory cells develop. A mucus type which is present prebubertally and menopausal, when the other types of mucus are present only in minuscule amounts, is called F for fundamental/fetal. This was discovered in 1994 and is believed to have no role in fertility.

**_Mucus follows a typical pattern of behaviour:_**

1.  It is always synthesized by an epithelial cell as a molecule of mucin
2.  Released as a mucin molecule from the cell
3.  Activated, i.e. the mucin molecule undergoes polymerization
4.  Carries out an activity, i.e. sperm conduction
5.  Undergoes mucolysis (degradation, depolymerization) with or without mucolytic enzymes
6.  Mucus and/or its products of degradation are perceptible at the vulva as a sensation or as observable mucus [\[2\]](https://justisse.ca/index.php/college/courseware/print_pages#_ftn2) 

**_Mucus may be characterized by four qualities:_**

1.  Viscosity
2.  Transparency
3.  Stretchiness
4.  Capacity for sperm conduction[\[3\]](https://justisse.ca/index.php/college/courseware/print_pages#_ftn3)

Sperm conduction is dependent upon the quantity and quality of 'ferning'. Ferning can be described as the pattern of channels formed by various types of mucus, visible under low power field microscope, when the mucus is allowed to dry and crystallize. It is the presence or absence of ferning which determines the capacity for sperm conduction. There is a coincidental increase in the ferning and the number of channels as estradiol 17-beta increases, hence also as peak day approaches; the largest number of channels is observed on peak day. Ferning is due to the formation of crystals that develop from the high concentration of sodium and potassium salts in the mucus.

Differences in these four characteristics are what allow us to distinguish between the various types of cervical mucus.

___

### G, L, S, and P Mucus Types -- A Primer {.unnumbered}

Between 1966 and 1993 various researchers, notably Erik Odeblad and colleagues, identified several discrete types of cervical mucus: **G, L, S, P** **mucus**, each produced in response to varying levels of **estrogens**, **progesterone** and **noradrenalin**. 

#### G Mucus {.unnumbered}

**G mucus** is sub-divided into **G+** and **G- mucus.** A **Gp mucus ('p' for pregnancy)** is produced during pregnancy. G mucus does not demonstrate channels or ferning and as such is theoretically impenetrable to sperm. G mucus has a high viscosity giving it an elastic or rubbery quality. G mucus is in the cervical canal during the preovulatory phase before the onset of fertile quality L, S, and P mucus, and during the post ovulatory phase. Elevated progesterone levels postovulatory and during pregnancy increase G mucus secretion. G mucus is produced in the lower portion of the cervix. G mucus contains immunoglobulins and other anti-microbial properties that protect from pathogens entering the uterine cavity. When the G mucus is present a woman has a dry sensation and notices no mucus when she follows the observational routine.

### L, S, and P Mucus {.unnumbered}

It is **L, S** and **P mucus,** named **_E-type mucus_** in the Justisse User's Guide which collectively form the flow of mucus that women may observe and interpret as non-peak and peak mucus.

#### L Mucus {.unnumbered}

The cervix secretes **L mucus** during the fertile phase preovulatory. The L mucus secreting crypts are distributed along the length of the endocervical canal, but are most numerous in the lower half of the canal. As estrogen levels rise toward ovulation L mucus secretion occurs first. The fluid L mucus descends down the endocervical canal dislodging the G mucus plug. When L mucus exceeds about 50% of total mucus secretions a woman will begin to notice a change in the nature of the discharge from her vagina. L mucus is sticky, a bit elastic, and opaque or translucent in color; what we typically call non-Peak mucus. Microscopically, L mucus develops the typical 'ferning' pattern commonly associated with cervical mucus.

L mucus has 4 functions. 1) it alkalizes vaginal secretions to enhance sperm survival, 2) creates the supportive structure for S mucus 'swimming lanes', together which facilitate sperm transport, 3) acts as a biological filter to screen out defective sperm, and 4) close S crypt openings once they contain about 20 to 30 sperm.

#### P Mucus {.unnumbered}

Nor-adrenalline and estrogen stimulate P mucus secretion from the upper reaches of the endocervical canal. **P mucus** facilitates the down flow of the G mucus plug and L mucus. P mucus secretion is maximum at the beginning of the fertile phase. P mucus has numerous sub sets. Two of these are  **P2 ak**a **Pa mucus ('a' for action) and** **P6 mucus**.

P2 mucus is mucolytic, giving it the ability to liquefy G mucus and thin out L mucus. It is secreted in the upper half of the cervix and is maximally produced 4 to 8 days preovulation. Liquefying (mucolysis)  the G mucus allows better flow of L mucus. Thinning L mucus allows for better flow of S mucus, which is necessary to move the sperm into the cervical crypts. Mucolysis of L mucus unblocks the crypts so that sperm can continue journeying to the uterine cavity. 

P6 mucus facilitates sperm transport from S mucus crypts into the uterine cavity. It is secreted in the upper 1/6th of the endocervical canal, which is the junction with the body of the uterus (isthumus). P6 production is maximum at the end of the fertile phase and briefly after ovulation. P6 mucus production is maximum around PK-Day and the sensation associated with it is obvious lubrication and liquidity that allows for stretchiness of an 2 to 5 cm. If mucolysis is excessive then the mucus loses it quality of stretchiness. There is a sensation of lubrication but nothing can be finger-tested off the tissue. 

#### S mucus {.unnumbered}

**S Mucus** descends from the upper half of the cervical crypts about 1 to 3 days after the appearance of L mucus. The peaking estrogen levels prior to ovulation stimulate S mucus production. S mucus is fluid and when it is equal in volume to the L mucus a woman will notice that her mucus secretions have a lubricative (slippery) sensation that will remain until PEAK-day if all unfolds physiologically correct.

S mucus transports and nourishes sperm. It forms swimming lanes for sperm to travel through the endocervical canal to the S crypts. This happens very rapidly -- within 3 to 10 minutes. Sperm can survive in the S crypts for up to 5 days. The swimming fluid created by S mucus are supported architecturally by L mucus.

The mucus qualities of **clear, stretchy, or lubricative** are due to the combined effects of L, S, and P mucus.

Generally speaking, mucus-producing cells respond slowly to estrogen and progesterone, taking from one to several hours to begin or end mucus production. In contrast, **S** and **P** cells are able to begin or end mucus production much more quickly due to their SNS (sympathetic nervous system) innervation.

Be careful with these 'false forms” of P mucus!! The subunit (“mucin molecule”, MW 60,000) is nearly the same, but polymerizes differently in the mucus types: irregularly in G mucus; quadangular in L mucus, liner in S mucus, and trigonal in P mucus.

### The Cervix Herself: The uterus and its cervical crypts {.unnumbered}

Figure 1: The uterus and cervical crypts

The cervix herself is a complex and luscious labyrinth, described by Kevin Hume as possessing “folds” and “grapes”, clefts, crypts and tunnels.[\[4\]](https://justisse.ca/index.php/college/courseware/print_pages#_ftn4) 

Cervical crypts are found within the endocervical canal which opens into the vagina through the cervical os. The endocervical canal and the crypts are a mucus membrane comprised of three types of cells: columnar secretory cells, columnar ciliated cells and reserve cells. The ciliated cells beat in synchronicity to help mucus move out of the cervix. The non-ciliated epithelial cells function in the production and secretion of mucus. Each type of mucus (**G, L, S,** and **P**) is produced in its own crypt within the cervix. The location of each crypt-type relates directly to the function of each type of mucus. Crypts may fuse together or share an orifice. Fusion of crypts occurs frequently during pregnancy. Mucus leaving the cervix is a varying combination of **L, S, P2** and **P6** mucus. 

The **isthmus of the cervix** is 5-7mm in length and is located between the body of the uterus and the remainder of the cervix. It is illustrated in grey. The isthmus contains glands which secrete substance Z, containing mucolytic enzymes.  

The cervix is directly innervated by the **sympathetic nervous system**. Although it is not fully understood, it is known that **noradrenalin**, produced by the sympathetic nervous system plays a role in stimulating the secretion of **S mucus**.

#### Mucus Production over the Menstrual Cycle

Please review Unit C Section 2.5 Nature's Gate and Nature's Gate in the Justisse User's Guide (2009) book p.10. 

Immediately following menstruation, even under the influence of low levels of progesterone, the cervix is rapidly filled with **G- mucus**, forming an effective antimicrobial plug. 

In the pre-ovulatory phase, the cycle begins as Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) reaches its threshold level. Below threshold level, most follicles are dormant. However, some follicles are more sensitive to FSH than others, perhaps due to a better blood supply and respond to rising levels of FSH before other follicles do, allowing ultimately for the conservation of follicles. 

Once threshold level of FSH is reached, follicles begin to grow and eventual rising levels of estrogens signal to the hypothalamus and pituitary that an adequate level of FSH has been reached to initiate follicular development. FSH must then exceed an intermediate level on order for the follicle to reach its full maturity.

As the follicle develops, the number of granulosa cells increase, in turn producing rising levels of estrogens. As the dominant follicle increases its production of estrogens, the rising levels of estrogens act on the pituitary gland to decrease its production of FSH. Because the dominant follicle has decreased its threshold for FSH-stimulated growth, it is able to continue its process of maturation, while other follicles cease their growth due to inadequate FSH-levels.  

As levels of estrogens begin to rise, the L cells are stimulated to produce **L mucus**. **L mucus** is produced in the crypts illustrated in green. It is named 'L' for the log shape of its rectangular crystals. Its existence was first confirmed in 1977. The role of **L mucus** is to attract and lock-in malformed sperm, which it is believed to accomplish both by its log shape, but also possible due to its glycoprotein structure. It has a medium viscosity and is produced in response to medium and rising levels of estrogen.

Each L crypt fills with mucus and then expels the mucus in the shape of a pearl, eventually forming what appears like a string of pearls, which provides a framework of mechanical support for the S mucus which will shortly appear.

The descent of L mucus to the vulva is facilitated by mucolytic enzymes (carried by **Pa mucus**, highest at the start of the fertile phase) which are produced by the isthmus. Their job is to help liquefy the mucus**_. The woman will begin to observe cervical mucus when L mucus surpasses 50% of the total mucus production, often as non-peak mucus with a smooth or sticky sensation._**

As estrogen continues to increase, the cervix begins to produce **S mucus**. **S mucus** is produced in the crypts illustrated in blue. Its existence was also confirmed in 1977. The 'S' of S mucus stands for sperm, as the purpose of **S mucus** is to transport sperm. It is produced in crypts close to isthmus of cervix - where secretion Z originates from (see **Other Contributors to the Mucus Flow** below). **S mucus** is very fluid and has a low viscosity. It forms crystals that look like small, thin needles, creating canals (the micelles) through which sperm can rapidly swim. S mucus transports sperm into the S crypts, where sperm “rest” and undergo capacitation for several hours up to several days. When sperm enter the S crypts, a woman may observe a decrease in S mucus production that lasts for up to a day. It is not known why this happens (although we may surmise that having got their man, so to speak, there is time for a respite in mucus production).

**S mucus** is stimulated by high estrogen levels. Ovarian estradiol reaches its peak approximately 36 hours before ovulation, which is what stimulates the surge of luteinizing hormone (LH). Although levels of estrogens have already begun to drop a day or two (or even up to several days) [\[5\]](https://justisse.ca/index.php/college/courseware/print_pages#_ftn5) prior to Peak Day, S mucus continues to be produced and secreted due to stimulation of the crypts by noradrenalin. Progesterone begins to climb just prior to peak, as the LH surge leads to some luteinization of the follicle _before_ ovulation and continues to climb until it reaches its highest level several days following peak.

Simultaneous to the appearance of S mucus, **P6 mucus** appears and begins to increase. **P mucus** is produced in the crypts illustrated in yellow in Figure 1. Its existence was confirmed in 1990. The enzyme-containing granules found in cervical mucus have a strong affinity for P mucus, assisting in mucolysis of S and L mucus as ovulation approaches. This mucus facilitates the upward movement of sperm from the S-crypts. **P6 mucus** production may also be stimulated by noradrenalin. When crystallized, **P mucus** possesses a hexagonal star-shape, while **Pa mucus** crystallizes in the form of feathers or “plumes”. **The introduction of S mucus and P6 mucus changes the quality of the sensation observed to one of slipperiness and lubrication. In addition to the appearance of S and P6 mucus, mucolytic enzymes continue to increase, which enhances the sensation of lubrication.  _Then, very quickly after ovulation G+ mucus is produced and soon comprises 100% of the mucus._**

### Other Contributors to the Mucus Flow {.unnumbered}

In addition to **L, S** and **P mucus**, **F mucus**, produced by fetal cells left in the cervix also contributes to the mucus symptom. **F mucus** is named for 'fundamental' due the theory that it is more fundamental or original that the differentiated crypt cells. It is possible that F cells differentiate into P, S, L and G cells.  

**F mucus** is found in the epithelium covering the endocervical wall between the openings to the crypts. It resembles G mucus, but lacks its characteristic leukocytes and lymphocytes. F mucus is to a large degree made up of the membranous glycoproteins of F cells that have been exfoliated. F mucus forms irregular shaped crystals.

**F mucus** is produced on a generally consistent basis over the course of the menstrual cycle; however its levels decrease during the fertile phase.

**Secretion Z** are granules containing mucolytic enzymes, and is also present at varying levels during the fertile phase. The mucolytic enzyme of secretion Z cause a rapid increase in the breakdown of cervical mucus, creating for the very liquid and lubricious nature of the mucus flow close to Peak Day. Increased breakdown of the cervical mucus liberates sperm for transport into the uterine space by P mucus.

The mucus flow is also comprised of contributions from the **isthmus**, the **endometrium** and **fallopian tubes**. Also detectable in the mucus flow during ovulation is **peritoneal** and **follicular fluid**.

### Vaginal Cell Slough {.unnumbered}

The intermediate cells of the vagina also produce mucus made up of membranous glycoproteins which is normally re-absorbed by the **pockets of Shaw** (illustrated in light pink). Because this mucus is re-absorbed during infertile phases, women report a sensation of dryness during those times. During the pre-ovulatory phase, rising levels of estrogen lead to an increase in the proliferation of the epithelial cells in the vagina, temporarily decreasing re-absorption by the pockets of Shaw. This increase in vaginal mucus and cell slough flows out of the vagina and contributes in part to the wet, slippery sensation of the fertile phase. Women may report a non-lubricative shiny spot on their tissue, named a **'4'** observation, before or after a hormonal shift (prior to observation of cervical mucus or at the end of a fertile phase) - the shiny spot, when rubbed, will disappear and there will be **no** sensation of lubrication. This observation is vaginal mucus. They may also notice a 6PC observation with a smooth or dry sensation. (See [Unit C on Basic Infertile Pattern](https://justisse.ca/index.php/college/courseware/page/1081) and [Unit G Section 7 Identifying the Basic Infertile Pattern](https://justisse.ca/index.php/college/courseware/page/1314) for finer details on this point.)

The mineral manganese is involved in the re-absorptive capacity of the pockets of Shaw; a deficiency may be considered if a woman frequently notes a **'4'** observation on her chart.

The maturation of the **pockets of Shaw** is delayed by the use of the pill during adolescence.

### G Type Mucus During Infertile Phases of the Menstrual Cycle {.unnumbered}

During infertile phases of the menstrual cycle, **G mucus**, a high viscosity mucus, rich in immunoglobins and antimicrobial agents, forms a plug in the cervix.The purpose of **G mucus!** is to protect the upper reproductive system and peritoneal cavity from invasion by pathogens. Because of its additional roles in immunity, **G mucus** contains contributions from leukocytes and lymphocytes in addition to epithelial cells. Changing types and quantities of interleukins may account for variation in lymphocytes and leukocytes.

In response to relatively low progesterone low following menstruation, **G- mucus** is produced by the cervical crypts, which creates an impenetrable plug in the endocervical canal. This mucus plug protects the upper reproductive organs and peritoneal cavity from pathogenic invasion. G- mucus remains in place until the beginning of the mucus phase prior to ovulation when E mucus is produced. E mucus dissolves G-mucus and then becomes the dominant secretion from the cervical crypts and is readily noticed at the vulva. 

**G+ mucus** is produced in response to the high levels of progesterone following ovulation and functions similarly to G- mucus. G+ mucus is not produced in the absence of ovulation.

**Gp mucus** is produced during pregnancy as is stimulated as a result of the even more elevated levels of progesterone. Gp mucus is more viscous than G+ mucus. 

[[C2.9-ferning-odeblad-3.png]]![link to image](https://justisse.ca/MediaGallery/HRHP%20Images/HRHP/UnitJ/Cervical%20Mucus%20Ferning%20Odeblad%203.jpg)
Figure: Type G mucus (From the BOM website)

When **G mucus is** present, most women will observe a dry sensation and observe no mucus. On occasion, some **G mucus** may break away from the cervical plug and descend to the vulva; a woman may note a gummy, rubbery mucus discharge.

### Variability in the Mucus Symptom {.unnumbered}

One of the most important aspects of the JM method is the recognition that the mucus symptom varies from cycle to cycle. The number of days of mucus, the quantity of mucus and the quality of mucus can and will vary from cycle to cycle. **_It is essential that women using the Justisse Method are well aware of this fact and do not fall into the habit of predicting their times of fertility or interpreting their symptoms in the context of what has occurred in previous cycles._**

The variability of the fertile phase may be due to a number of factors. However, one important aspect of mucus to keep in mind is what Odeblad terms the “biosynthetic” properties of mucus.[\[6\]](https://justisse.ca/index.php/college/courseware/print_pages#_ftn6) Mucus-secreting cells must be supplied with the raw materials of mucus production (glucose, oxygen, amino acids and estrogen); there is variability in access to these raw materials based on the cells distance from the capillaries which supply the cells. Mucus-secreting cells are also constantly aging and being replaced; the age of cells may play a role in the quantity and quality of their mucus secretion. Finally, receptor sensitivity and receptor degradation most likely play a role in the variability of mucus production from cycle to cycle.

### Changes in Mucus over the Lifespan {.unnumbered}

In young women around puberty, S-crypts are numerous. Over time, S-crypts are replaced to a degree by L-crypts, while G-crypts also undergo transformation to L-crypts. The normal G-to-L and S-to-L transformations are partially reversed by pregnancy.

The quantity and quality of mucus also changes over the course of the reproductive lifespan. In younger women, the quantity of mucus is not usually at its maximum on Peak Day. Instead, the quantity and stretchiness tend to be greatest on the day preceding Peak Day. In older women, who tend to experience shorter fertile phases, the quantity and stretchiness are highest on Peak Day.

Younger women also tend to have increased levels of P mucus at the time of ovulation as well as increased levels of mucolytic activity leading to an enhanced sensation of lubrication

### The Cervix, Mucus and Contraceptive Endocrine Disruptors {.unnumbered}

 The normal G-to-L and S-to-L transformations are accelerated by use contraceptive endocrine disruptors. **_For each year of birth control pill use, the cervix ages an extra year_**, which becomes deeply problematic when a woman has been using the birth control pill for an extended number of years, leading to the possibility of scant cervical mucus or limited or absent peak mucus.

Oral contraceptives lead to an “excessive development of G cells in the lower cervix”, according to Kevin Hume.[\[7\]](https://justisse.ca/index.php/college/courseware/print_pages#_ftn7) In addition, contraceptive endocrine disruptors have been demonstrated to narrow the cervical canal. Long-term use leads to attrition from disuse due the suppressive action of CEDs' progestins on the S cells. Odeblad has also confirmed the atrophy of S-crypts after long-term use of CED's and accredits the use of such contraceptives to infertility for this very reason.

### Missed Mucus Symptoms {.unnumbered}

Some women experience a **_rare_** disorder where they miss their mucus symptom. Estrogenic hormones cause a contraction in the sacro-uterine ligament, temporarily closing the external os, preventing the woman from observing her mucus symptom. These women also tend to exhibit signs of anti-Mullerian activity, including a small amount of cervical mucosa and impaired ovarian function.

### Conclusion {.unnumbered}

The HRHP trainee has by now, surmised that the quantity, quality, and length of the mucus phase, the type of mucus observed, the length of the luteal phase are all direct reflections of the hormonal ebb and flow and of the health of the cervix as well as the mucus membranes of each individual woman. In the following sections, we will explore in depth the majority of the disorders the HRHP will encounter in her practice and how they are reflected in menstrual cycle charts as well as what atypical charts indicate when presented by a charting woman.
