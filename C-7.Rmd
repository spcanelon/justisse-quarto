### Mapping the 5th Vital Sign: Critical Reproductive Health Care for Females {.unnumbered}

_Regular Ovulation and True Menstruation together are the 5th Vital Sign of Women's Life Long Health. This section of Unit C is not required reading material. You will not be examined on it. However, it provides an overview of the place of fertility awareness in modern times. Also, it contains material that at some point in your HRHP career you will find useful._

This is a transcription of a public lecture given by Geraldine Matus May 2007, Edmonton, Alberta. Interdisciplinary Health Practices Study Group (This topic is revisited in Unit H). Please be tolerant as the language is not gender neutral, but was not changed in order to maintain the urtext.

**To Begin With ... **

-   **What Is True In Research And Media Focusing On Women's Sexual And Reproductive Health?**

How do we make sense of all the research and media that focuses on women's sexual and reproductive health? Whether we are a health care provider or consumer -- how do we tell the difference between what is truth or what statistics are doing the hokey-pokey and turning us around - until we are too dizzy to think straight or connect meaningfully with what we want or need? I suggest that we more closely approach the truth when:

1.  We ask investigative questions - even when others prefer that we swallow their truth
2.  Become undefended learners
3.  Develop a broad knowledge about what is truth - orthodox and apocryphal
4.  Be cautious about assuming that 'experts' are always 'experts'
5.  Learn to talk back to statistics. 

-   **Talk Back to Statistics**
-   **Be an Undefended Learner**

1.  I invite you to talk back to the statistics I present.
2.  I invite you to listen with undefended ears.
3.  I invite you to make note of any questions you might have so I can address them during the question and answer period of this presentation. 

-   **Reproductive Freedom Exists Only With Full Disclosure And Full Access**

As I speak tonight, I invite you to be mindful of the premise that is foundational to my work with women's sexual and reproductive health. 

A woman, regardless of age or reproductive stage, can only exercise sexual and reproductive choice, when she has been given full disclosure about her choices, including all the risks and benefits, and a functional knowledge of how the workings of her sexual reproductive self. Reproductive freedom exists only with full disclosure and full access. 

-   **Misgivings And Anxiety About The Merits Of Synthetic Sex Hormone Replacement Therapy (S-HRT)**

Recent media coverage of the outcome of the National Institute of Health (NIH) and Women's Health Initiative (WHI) research projects has aroused significant misgivings and anxiety among consumers, health care providers, and sexual and reproductive health educators about the merits of synthetic sex hormone replacement therapy (HRT). The pharmaceutical solution women had hoped would save them from declining hormone levels and the ravages of its attendant cardio-vascular diseases, autoimmune disorders, breast and other cancers, osteoporosis, and dementias failed to honour the sentiment of the Hippocratic Oath - primum non nocere - first do no harm. 

-   **Space Alien Molecules &** **Respecting Female Rhythms**

The histories of patentable drugs containing synthetic sex hormones (sex steroids) and agents designed to disrupt the normal rhythms of endocrine function have had a disconcerting history of noteworthy and long-term deleterious side effects. There is no indisputable evidence to support the safe or efficacious use of these drugs - on or off label - despite the plethora of research, reformulations, and reassurances to consumers and prescribing practitioners that has developed since the 1940s - when work with these substances began. 

Based on my research and clinical experience, I would agree with complementary medicine physician Dr. Jonathan Wright that putting these patentable drugs into the bodies of women is ultimately deleterious, and likely in ways we have yet to discover. Dr. Wright refers to them as “space alien molecules (Wright JV, 2005)”, and, I suggest, appropriately so. 

I consider it prudent for health care providers to attend to the rhythmic nature of the female body when making any intervention concerning women's health, and particularly reproductive health. The endocrine system governs a woman's body rhythmically to create the menstrual cycle. Similarly - that is rhythmically - it influences every other endocrine process to interface with the menstrual cycle. The ebb and flow of the sex hormones awakens every other endocrine hormone, and many neurohormones, to rhythmic dance of its processes. The woman's endocrine system governs her body like the tides govern the ocean. Imagine what would happen to the shipping or fishing industries if they refused to acknowledge the reality of tidal rhythms? It would be foolhardy to say the least. So to if health care providers fail to acknowledge the rhythmic nature of a woman's physiological processes. 

Synthetic sex hormones significantly alter the physiologically healthy tidal rhythms of a woman's body, replacing them with static states (Depo-Provera) or imposing foreign rhythms (S-HRT). It is important that any bio-identical hormonal replacement therapy, or other supportive reproductive health therapies be given in physiologically harmonious ways:

1.  In physiological amounts
2.  Timed according to physiological rhythms
3.  Physiologically identical or harmonious with nature's way 

It is prudent for health care providers to ask themselves if they are repairing the finely tuned “Swiss watch” of a woman's reproductive system with jeweller's tools or a jackhammer.

## 7.2 - Bio-Identical Hormones {.unnumbered}

-   **Surge of interest in bio-identical and hormone replacement therapies (BHRT) and alternative medicine approaches to health.**

The fear of and disinclination to use S-HRT has caused a surge of interest in Alternative and Complementary Medicine approaches to Western medical, dietary and lifestyle advice. There is a new interest in bio-identical hormone replacement therapies (BHRT). The question of using BHRT creates for woman a challenge similar to that of using S-HRT. How do women and health care providers puzzle their way through the BHRT covey of charlatans, geniuses, sound clinicians, and educators? 

Perhaps, the good news about BHRT therapies is that they were the corner stone of the earliest hormone trials and research that demonstrated remarkable successes. BHRTs were however rejected as suitable for the marketplace of women's bodies in favour of patented sex hormones, which made better financial cornerstones for struggling and emerging pharmaceutical companies. The renaissance of BHRT demonstrates dramatic promise in the maintenance of reproductive health, and treatment of endocrine disorders, including menstrual irregularities, infertility, and health problems associated with aging reproductive systems. 

-   **How does a woman know what is best for her - of what in the media she is exposed to should she believe?**

However, the question remains of how does a woman know what is best for her? Or a health care provider for the women they serve? Of what in the media that we are exposed to should we believe? These are complicated questions, and made more so by exponential growth of media espousing what is the truth about reproductive health, choices, and products - with much of it diametrically opposed as to what is true and what constitutes sound health or health care practice. 

-   **Media coverage of study on follicular development claims women ovulate twice in one cycle!!! Something more to be afraid of??**

For example, in June 2003, multiple media outlets misrepresented the work of Dr. Roger Pierson on follicular development and ovulation. The media stated variously that women could ovulate twice in one cycle, creating a great fear among women, especially those who used natural birth control methods. Though several media outlets rectified the errors and re-established that women ovulate only once per menstrual cycle, there lingers fear among women that indeed the first report might be true [\[1\]](https://justisse.ca/index.php/college/courseware/print_pages#_ftn1)  - fears more difficult to remedy than editing media copy. 

To a woman who charts her menstrual cycles and is intimate with her reproductive rhythms, the kerfuffle over the media misrepresentation would have been unimportant - because they would have known already that they cannot ovulate more than once a cycle; right knowledge - no fear.

[\[1\]](https://justisse.ca/index.php/college/courseware/print_pages#_ftnref1) Dr. Pierson himself refused to make a public statement to clarify that women ovulate only once per cycle, but he has acknowledged the error in a private correspondence with Geraldine Matus. As of 2015 Dr. Pierson has responded to the feedback about his research and in particular the media's less than responsible way of presenting it. [A cautionary tale about research that touches a nerve](http://news.usask.ca/articles/research/2012/a-cautionary-tale-about-research-that-touches-a-nerve.php).

## 7.3 - We Are Women, We Are Not Sick {.unnumbered}

-   **Menstrual suppression - “to bleed or not to bleed” - Depo-Provera and “black box warning” - bone density and who knows what else?**

A contentious controversy about women's reproductive health is that of menstrual suppression - “to bleed or not to bleed” - initiated by Dr. Elsimar Coutino, inventor of and advocate for the wide spread use of medroxy-progesterone acetate - Depo-Provera (Coutinho & Segal, 1999). The Depo-Provera contraceptive injection, once considered best contender for “ideal” contraceptive and menstrual suppressor, is now, as of November 17, 2004, packaged with a U.S. FDA “black box warning,” the same black box warning used on cigarette packaging. Depo-Provera use is strongly correlated with up to 6% reduction in bone mass density. Several colleagues have shared with me cases of patients in their late teens and early twenties who while on Depo-Provera sought medical attention for stress fractures and were never advised of the connection. For years, well before the black box warning health care providers were expressing reluctance to consider menstrual suppression as harmless and expressed considerable concern about the long-term consequences to women's health. Dr. Susan Rako (Rako, 2003) in her book _No More Periods: The Risk of Menstrual Suppression and Other Cutting-Edge Issues About Hormones and Women's Health_ provides vital and helpful information for women considering menstrual suppression or those who have wives, daughters, granddaughters considering such. 

![[C7.3-1-we-are-not-sick.png]][link to image](https://justisse.ca/MediaGallery/HRHP%20Images/HRHP/UnitC/We%20are%20not%20sick%20we%20are%20women.jpg)

The poster _We are Not Sick We Are Women_ created by the Canadian Women's Health Network protests the fundamental premise of menstrual suppression - that menstruation creates illness in women. This premise loses ground when we consider that the human female has been menstruating, and indeed carrying out all her other reproductive functions for millions of years without the benefit of modern science, and without the species becoming extinct. Ironically, it is modern medicine and modern life that is most likely to contribute to the extinction of the human species than any flaw in the design of the human reproductive system.  Once again primum non nocere - first do no harm.

-   **Push And Pull For The Market Share Of Women's Ovaries And Attendant Organs.**
-   **The Bodies Of Women ... The Most Researched, Commodified, And Exploited Of Any Animal Species Or Sex**

Even the well-read and savvy women are overwhelmed and daunted by the push and pull for market share of their ovaries and attendant organs. It would be fair to claim that the bodies of women are the most researched, commodified, and exploited of any animal species or sex. Then, who and what can women trust when deliberating about their sexual and reproductive health choices? 

As a woman who has had her share of consumer experience in the sexual and reproductive health market, I empathize with women's suspicions and fears. As health care providers, you or I might say “you can trust me” believing that we know what is best. However, how can a woman trust that we would not falsely guide them? Do we indeed know what is best for them? Do we indeed even know the detailed and individual workings of their body and reproductive cycle? Have we taken time to learn about it in general and in particular from them? Why should it matter that we do so?  

**When delivering reproductive health care or education to women, I find it prudent to ask myself the following:**

1.  Am I contributing to the commodification of women's bodies through the support or use of agents, procedures, beliefs, and behaviours
2.  Am I respecting the rhythmicity of women's body
3.  Am I encouraging women to look to their own knowledge of their body
4.  Am I helping women become as knowledgeable about their body's as is necessary for them to make healthful choices
5.  Am I encouraging women to talk back to statistics, and make sure the experts really are experts
6.  Am I respecting the mystery and needs of the individual

## 7.4 - Rubenstein Announces the 5th Vital Sign

### The Menstrual Cycle ... The 5th Vital Sign Of Woman's Health ... Society for Menstrual Cycle Research {.unnumbered}

On September 21, 2004 advocates for women's sexual and reproductive health met at a scientific forum titled, "The Menstrual Cycle is a Vital Sign," held at the New York Academy of Sciences (Rubinstein et al., 2004). The purpose of the meeting was to increase awareness about the role of the menstrual cycle as a unique indicator of a woman's overall physical health. At the conference, Paula Hillard, M.D., professor of obstetrics & gynecology and pediatrics at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine stated, “The menstrual cycle is a window into the general health and well-being of women, and not just a reproductive event.” “It can indicate the status of bone health, heart disease, and ovarian failure, as well as long-term fertility. Therefore, if a woman is not having her period, it is the first sign that something else could be going on.” 

Jerilynn Prior, M.D., professor of endocrinology and metabolism at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, and board member for the Society for Menstrual Cycle Research stated “We as a society are allowing the one vital sign unique to women to go unmonitored, which could ultimately lead to an enormous uncontrolled experiment with a woman's health.” The forum emphasized the importance of the relationship between women and their menstrual cycles as vital to monitoring women's health, and encouraged interactive dialogue between women and their health care providers about their menstrual cycle in managing their overall health. 

### Endocrine System . . . 2nd Most Important Physiological System {.unnumbered}

The endocrine system is the second most important physiological system of the human body. The first is the central nervous system (CNS). When the endocrine system functions poorly all systems suffer, particularly the critical interface between the central nervous system and the endocrine system. A moment's reflection on how intimately the unfolding of the menstrual cycle interfaces with the endocrine system, helps to underscore the good sense of nominating the menstrual cycle “The 5th Vital Sign” of a woman's health. The other four vital signs of health are the heartbeat, breathing rate, temperature, and blood pressure. A woman, who is not ovulating and menstruating regularly and normally, will experience some degree of compromised cardio-vascular, neurochemical, endocrine, or immunological health. The older she is the more she will be aware of the symptoms of a poorly functioning endocrine cycle as they manifest in various changes of her menstrual cycle. When a woman monitors her menstrual cycle, she has a window into the functioning of her endocrine system once she learns how to interpret what she sees.

## 7.5 - Body Literacy {.unnumbered}

### Body Literacy {.unnumbered}

### Teaching every woman how to observe, chart, and make sense of her menstrual cycle events. {.unnumbered}

I support an interactive dialogue between a woman and her health care provider, and propose that such a dialog cannot take place until a woman understands for herself the workings of her menstrual cycle. By learning about the workings of her menstrual cycle a woman takes the steps towards learning whom and what to trust regarding her sexual and reproductive health. 

The ambition of holistic reproductive health care for women is integrating care and education through a woman's lifespan, from first menstruation to beyond menopause, including childbearing and breastfeeding. Additionally, maternal health and well-being affects the future reproductive health of the child, and diet, lifestyle, and environment influence reproductive health before puberty.  An example of how mysterious, and indeed interconnected our reproductive health is with what may seem remote events in our lives, is the fact that a woman who breastfeeds her infant daughter for one year, reduces her daughters chance of getting breast cancer by 23% (Wiley, 2003). 

At Justisse Healthworks for Women our goal is to teach every woman how to observe, chart, and make sense of her menstrual cycle events - help her understand the significance of her menstrual cycle as the 5th Vital Sign of her health. We call this Body Literacy. 

### Why should we care that women learn to observe, chart and make sense of her menstrual cycle events? {.unnumbered}

I am aware that my audience includes men as well as women. Why should men care about the issues presented here? Why would men support women learning to observe, chart and make sense of their menstrual cycle events?  Why would a woman want to learn how to observe, chart and make sense of her menstrual cycle events?  My first response is, if we care about the continuation and health of our species - if we want children and grandchildren - then it is important that we care, regardless of our gender, about the reproductive health of women. 

### Increased incidence of menstrual cycle irregularities and infertility . . . {.unnumbered}

Rising rates of infertility for both sexes in North America and other Westernized nations are frankly disturbing. The concern about infertility goes beyond well beyond the unhappiness of couples that have difficulty conceiving. Infertility in both sexes is a warning signal that the endocrine system is not functioning optimally, a physiological situation that has various and long-term health consequences, and particularly so for women and their offspring. It is important to be mindful that our physiology is designed specifically for us to reproduce. 

### Are we good reproductive units ...? {.unnumbered}

If we are not good reproductive units (Wiley, 2003) then, from nature's point-of-view, there is no need for us to exist and utilize valuable resources that would be better spent on those who are reproductively viable. As our reproductive viability declines our risk for degenerative diseases increases. It is clear that the overall health of women depends on sound reproductive health and similarly for men. If a man cares about the health of the women in his personal life, and those in his care if he is a health care provider, he should care about the reproductive health of women. 

In the late 70s and early 80s, my client base included few women with menstrual cycle irregularities or couples concerned about infertility - perhaps 10 to 15%. Over the years I have witnessed a steady and alarming increase in these numbers. It is rare that I see a woman with a healthy menstrual cycle, even young women. Much of the fallout I witness with respect to menstrual cycle health is related to the use of hormonal contraceptives, as well as diet and lifestyles that are not supportive of reproductive health. The client's menstrual cycle chart is my best tool for: educating them about restoring and safeguarding their reproductive health, about how to make birth control choices that are optimal for their reproductive health, and to assist them in taking greater control over their sexual and reproductive health choices. The dominant side effect women experience when charting their menstrual cycles is an increased love for their bodies and its unique rhythmicity.

## 7.6 - Wiser Reproductive Health Consumer {.unnumbered}

### Women who chart their menstrual cycles become wiser sexual and reproductive health consumers . . . have more control over their choices. {.unnumbered}

Women who chart their cycles become better sexual and reproductive health consumers. They have the benefit of understanding how their body functions, which gives them greater power to make informed reproductive and sexual health decisions. They also have a focus point for discussion with their health care provider about treatment, and greater negotiating power when discussing reproductive health choices with their health care provider or sexual partner. 

### Diagnostic and reproductive health education tool. {.unnumbered}

Many health care providers and educators view fertility awareness as a method for birth control or conception assistance, and overlook its value as a diagnostic and reproductive health education tool.  Woman who chart know when they are fertile and when they are not. They have no need for hormonal contraceptives, I.U.Ds, or surgical sterilization and they can decrease or eliminate their use of barrier methods of contraception or emergency contraception. These are advantages, because these women do not have to sacrifice the well-being of their reproductive body to exercise reproductive choice. 

### Benefits for male partners of charting women. {.unnumbered}

Their male partners have the benefits of getting to keep their vas deferens intact (this has advantages for the man), and reduce or eliminate the need for using condoms (except for STI protection of course). Women not using hormonal contraceptives get to share the benefit of a normal sex drive (i.e., not suppressed by hormonal contraceptives) with their male partners - and the men get the benefit of that as well. Women not using hormonal contraceptives, I.U.D.s, and barrier methods suffer significantly less from chronic vaginal and bladder infections than women who use fertility awareness methods. If I were a male partner to a woman, or the father of a daughter whose sexual health I would only desire to be optimum all this would sound great to me. I would want to support the women in my life to learn to observe, chart, and interpret their menstrual cycle events.  Additionally, women who chart their menstrual cycles are more attuned to their sexual rhythms and desires, and are generally more comfortable with sexual dialog between them and their partners. This benefits both partners. And women can learn to chart regardless of age, or reproductive stage or situation. Those who care about the health of the women, will be interested in women having the opportunity to become intimately knowledgeable about the workings of their individual menstrual cycle rhythms and reproductive health. 

### Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) ... Scent of a woman ... the scent of a man...? {.unnumbered}

Finally, a most intriguing point - We have something called a Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC), which is a group of genes important for the processes of natural and sexual selection. The MHC influences our body odors (pheromones) and our preferences for difference body-odors, as well as determining our immunological threshold and general constitution. 

MHC is nature's elegant and ingenious way of influencing a woman to be attracted to a man who has a package of immunity-determining genes that will maximize the couples likelihood of being fertile, of carrying pregnancy through to term, and of bearing healthy and immunologically well-equipped children. (Rako, 2003) 

The mechanism of the MHC assists women and men in choosing genetically and immunologically advantageous partners for pair bonding through pheromone recognition of a best match partner. The ability for advantageous pair bond is debilitated in women who are using hormonal contraception or synthetic hormonal replacement therapies. Odor assessment and preference is radically altered when women use these hormones. (Rako, 2003; Wiley, 2003).  The role of MHC in pair bonding and the influence of synthetic hormone use among women is an important consideration when puzzling out issues of infertility, infant morbidity, and relationship stability among parenting partners. The scent of a woman . . . the scent of a man . . .?? Perhaps the perfume manufacturers ads about the mysterious interconnection between scent and pair bonding represents an intuitive understands of the workings of the MHC? 

### Menstrual chart . . . reproductive health mirror {.unnumbered}

As we proceed with this presentation, I invite you to be mindful of several points.

1.  The menstrual cycle chart is a mirror of the reproductive cycle and endocrine health.
2.  The Endocrine system, which governs reproductive health, is the second most important system in the human body after the CNS.
3.  Overall health and longevity depends on reproductive health.
4.  Any substance that affects the operation of our reproductive system affects our whole physiology in some way. No gland or hormone works in isolation.

-   **Learn the Basics of the Menstrual Cycle**
-   **Learn the Basics of Charting the Menstrual Cycle**
-   **Learn Normal Parameters of the Menstrual Cycle**
-   **Learn Elements of Atypical Menstrual Cycles**

We are going to now look at the basics of the menstrual cycle, the basics of menstrual cycle charting, and the normal parameters of the menstrual cycle. The purpose of this is to lay the groundwork demonstrating the usefulness of the menstrual cycle chart to women for monitoring their reproductive health, and for reproductive health care providers and educators. 

### Basic Menstrual Cycle Events and Signs to Chart (Record) {.unnumbered}

1.  Color code the observed menstrual cycle event - stamps, crayons, felts, beads
2.  Use a chart, day timer, calendar
3.  Red for menses HMLVL
4.  Green for infertile days
5.  Blue/purple/pink for fertile days
6.  Yellow for special charting considerations, such as basic infertile pattern of continuous non-peak mucus
7.  Record menstruation noting duration and flow of menses, and dates on which it occurred
8.  Record cycle length
9.  Identify ovulation or peak day
10.  Presence or absence of peak-type and non-peak type or fertile cervical mucus
11.  Record the length of the proliferative and luteal-phases
12.  Record daily morning BBT, preferably taken with a mercury thermometer, 10 minutes, underarm 

Charting the menstrual cycle events such as the duration and flow of menstrual bleeding, bleeding or spotting other than menstruation, the presence or absence of fertile cervical mucus, the cephalad shift (cervical changes), the basal body temperature (BBT) shift, mood changes, libido changes, food cravings, and other events related to menstrual cycle rhythms provide critical information on the state of a woman's endocrine and reproductive systems.

## 7.8 - Mapping Unhealthy Cycles {.unnumbered}

### Atypical Menstrual Cycle Events {.unnumbered}

Atypical menstrual cycle events may indicate a menstrual cycle problem or represent a normal variation of the female reproductive cycle over her lifespan. For example, the tendency for menstrual cycles to have a greater variation in length during the perimenopause is a normal variation. 

The presence of menstrual cycle problems is one of the most common reasons for women to seek medical advice. The menstrual cycle is sensitive to systemic disorders, particularly endocrine disorders such as hypothyroidism, Grave's disease, hyperinsulinism, Syndrome X (insulin resistance), PCOS, and others.  Additionally, environmental, dietary, physical, and psychological stress affects the menstrual cycle. Stress elevates cortisol and insulin levels, both of which have a suppressive effect on the reproductive hormone production and feedback (Vliet, 2003; Wiley, 2003).  Stress may contribute to the development or exacerbation of systemic disorders that affect the menstrual cycle, for example PCOS. 

Again I am mindful that from Nature's point-of-view a woman is not a viable reproductive unit when she is under stress, and so nature has designed the female body to down regulate its reproductive capacity until stressors are reduced. There is a positive correlation between menstrual cycle problems and stress.  However, menstrual cycle problems are symptomatic, not diagnostic. A thorough health history, particularly reproductive health history, appropriate laboratory testing and/or physical examination are necessary for a diagnosis, and before any treatment is started. 

Health care providers who understand how to interpret a woman's menstrual cycle chart will be better equipped for identifying and managing menstrual irregularities, as well as following up treatment progress and outcome.

### Usefulness of the Menstrual Cycle Chart for Women & Health Care Providers {.unnumbered}

The menstrual cycle chart is useful in identifying the following:

-   Vaginitis
-   Cervical polyps
-   Cervicitis
-   Cervical ectropion
-   Ovarian cysts
-   Possible endometrial pathology
-   Premenstrual symptoms (PMS)
-   Symptoms of IBS
-   Patterns of migraines
-   Endometriosis
-   Anovulation
-   Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)
-   Effects of stress
-   Eating disorders (bulemia, anorexia nervosa - thyroid disorders may be primary or secondary
-   Female athlete syndrome (low body weight, and often eating disorders)
-   Endocrine disorders and aberrations in hormonal sequencing (thyroid, adrenal, pituitary, hypothalmus)
-   Nutritional deficiencies
-   Mood disorders (bipolar disorder, depressive obsessive-compulsive)
-   Oligomenorrhea
-   Polymenorrhea
-   Amenorrhea
-   The rhythmic and physiologically harmonious administration of treatments and remedies - nutritional, vitamin, herbal, homeopathic, chiropractic, etc.
-   The rhythmic and physiologically harmonious administration of BHRT.
-   Monitoring outcome and efficacy of any reproductive health treatment, including nutritional, vitamin, or herbal supplementation
-   Facilitating timed serum, urine, or saliva hormonal evaluation and interpretation (e.g. mid-luteal phase progesterone level to assess fertility, and PMS)
-   Reducing the need for laboratory testing, when it is necessary to monitor certain endocrine functions (e. thyroid function, demonstrating ovulatory capacity, luteal phase defects, adrenal function)
-   Increasing self-management of reproductive health care.
-   Educating in preparation for puberty and menarche, or first intercourse.
-   A method of natural birth control, which eliminates the need for hormonal contraceptives, devices, and surgical procedures, and the potential damage these have on reproductive health.
-   Most prudent application of emergency contraception (ECP)
-   Planning conception, fertility treatments, and monitoring early pregnancy.
-   Identifying menstrual cycle and endocrine disorders as early as possible.
-   Identifying ovulation allows for a more accurate assessment of the mid-luteal phase date, and luteal phase defects.
-   Women to provide their healthcare providers with information useful for diagnosis and follow-up of treatment.
-   Women managing their life around problematic PMS, mennorrhagia, immunological health problems, timing menstrual hut/red tent ceremonies . . . .
-   Women with irregular cycles to know the exact day of their cycle

The more women understand the functioning of their fertility and menstrual cycle, as well as how it impacts their overall health, the more empowered they are to make fully informed decisions about how to manage their sexual and reproductive health. It encourages healthier lifestyles, choices, and self-mage. Charting her menstrual cycle rhythms is a life skill every woman should have the advantage of acquiring.  Over time a woman who charts learns the patterns of her menstrual cycle, and how to recognize her state of reproductive health.

### **Adolescent Women - Menstrual Irregularities And Pregnancy Prevention**  {.unnumbered}

Reproductive health care providers and educators of adolescent women are frequently urged to be mindful of teen pregnancy rates as they strive to prevent teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. Collectively these providers are educated to view oral contraceptives, as beneficial for preventing pregnancy as well as "regulating cycles" when young women present for care with menstrual irregularities. This group of women has the lowest compliance rates for oral contraceptive use, about 30%, and is the greatest sexual risk takers. To create better compliance Depo-Provera is now the drug of choice for many birth control clinics. Once the fear of pregnancy is removed by oral contraceptive, they uncommonly use condoms for STI prevention (Vigil P, 1993; Walker LO & Tinkle MB, 1996; Winikoff & Wymelenberg, 1992).  

I have serious concerns about the long-term wisdom of providing hormonal contraceptives to young woman with immature reproductive systems with no proven fertility, cycle regularity, or with irregular cycles without determining the cause of the irregular cycles(Vigil P, 1993). I am mindful that the diet and nutritional status of adolescent women is generally substandard, at a physiological stage of greatest nutrient need, second only to that of pregnancy and lactation. Hormonal contraceptives further compromise a challenged physiology (Martlew & Silver, 1989). I am also concerned about the wisdom of providing these women with hormonal contraception when they are not sexually active but “just in case” they become active. There is concern that provision of hormonal contraception in these instances, by removing the fear of pregnancy, initiates a young woman into a more complex sexual involvement than she might otherwise engage? I suggest that these women, in particular, are good candidates for learning to chart their menstrual cycle and take time to consider their choices. Many would argue with me. 

I have yet to experience clinically a manifestation of the often-expressed concern that teaching adolescent women how to chart their menstrual cycle and use that information for birth control will encourage greater sexual activity, especially intercourse. My clinical experience with adolescent women demonstrates exactly the opposite - a trend towards greater sexual prudence and modesty as these women become aware of their reproductive body and gain confident with charting (Schuster, 1979). Klaus and Martin (Klaus H & Martin JL, 1989) evaluated the usefulness for adolescent women in identifying ovulation \[and their fertile phase\] by self-detection of cervical mucus patterns. They concluded that adolescent women easily recognize their cervical mucus patterns and distinguish anovulatory from ovulatory cycles, regardless of ethnicity or socio-economic status. 

When young women speak to health care providers about menstrual cycle irregularities the cause of the abnormality should be determined first. Too frequently menstrual irregularities are managed with hormonal contraceptives, with the view of preventing 'teen pregnancy' at the same time as creating a sense of period rhythmicity - unfortunately the rhythmicity produced by hormonal contraceptives is not a physiologically normal or a healthy rhythmicity. Hormonal contraceptives have long-term consequences for health and fertility. 

Young women would be better served in the long term by investigating the cause of the abnormality and treating the disorder specifically. Teaching them how to chart their menstrual cycles has the benefits of

1.  Providing them with a birth control method if needed and only when needed
2.  Allowing for prudent and timely use of ECP
3.  Provide valuable feedback for their health care provider
4.  Empowering them with the knowledge of their bodies
5.  Providing the with one of the fundamental elements of “reproductive freedom through full disclosure” 

Charting the menstrual cycle is critical reproductive healthcare for adolescent women - this is making sure we tend to the 5th vital sign of a woman's health - from menarche to beyond menopause. The focus is not on directly "regulating" the cycle or viewing it through a medical/gynecologic lens, but using a more holistic approach to treating the cause. Women with mood disturbances and/or psychopathology associated with menstrual cycle disorders can be identified and referred for appropriate treatment, including counseling on healthy diet and lifestyle and how that impacts future health. 

### **It's My Ovaries Stupid - PCOS** {.unnumbered}

In her book, _It's My Ovaries Stupid_ (Vliet, 2003) Dr. Elizabeth Vliet addressed the growing number of menstrual cycle disorders among women, and in particular polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is becoming an increasingly common endocrine disorder with reproductive and metabolic consequences, including anovulation, ovarian dysfunction, infertility, and an increased prevalence of diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease(Solomon CG, Hu FB, & Dunaif A, 2001). From 5% to 10% of North American women are affected. It is strongly associated with obesity, central obesity, insulin resistance, and continuous elevated androgen (cortisol, DHEA) levels. Women with PCOS have an increased risk for type 2 diabetes, heart disease associated with insulin resistance (hyperinsulinemia, syndrome X, the metabolic syndrome), endometrial cancer, and hypertension - all impediments to lifelong health. Hyperinsulinemia interferes with FSH and LH secretion. Consequently this interferes with both ovarian follicular development (folliculogenesis) and luteinizing of the ovarian follicle after ovulation, which in turn has a deleterious effect on estradiol and progesterone production that are dependent on normal ovarian function. 

Oral contraceptives are often the treatment of choice for decreasing insulin sensitivity and regulating the menstrual cycles irregularities of women with PCOS. However, in recent research reveals that oral contraceptives have been shown to aggravate insulin resistance and other abnormal metabolic processes with long-term health consequences, especially in women with known insulin resistance and predisposition to type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Since PCOS is already associated with multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease, there is a concern about the wisdom of administering oral contraceptives to women with PCOS.  Hyperinsulinemia adversely affects endometrial functioning and the periimplantation environment. Which explains why women with PCOS are at greater risk for miscarriage primipara and recurrent miscarriage. In pregnancy, the insulin resistance associated with PCOS, gestational diabetes, and obesity carries an increased risk for macrosomia, hypertension, and pre-eclampsia. Maternal obesity increases perinatal mortality.

### The Menstrual Cycle And Thyroid Disease {.unnumbered}

Undiagnosed thyroid conditions underlie many menstrual cycle irregularities. This is an area that is not well understood by many medical professionals, though there is sound research indicating a significant link between menstrual irregularities and thyroid disease. 

Hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism or other thyroid disease may be an underlying condition in one or more of the following and warrant an assessment of thyroid function.

1.  precocious puberty/ early onset of menarche </= to 10 years of age
2.  delayed puberty/delayed onset of menarche > than 15 years of age
3.  menstrual bleeding lasting greater than 7 days
4.  lighter than normal/scant menstruation
5.  menorrhagia (heavy bleeding that last for greater than 24 hours)
6.  dysmenorrhea (painful menstruation)
7.  menstrual cycles less than 25 days long
8.  menstrual cycles greater than 40 days
9.  cessation of menstruation for greater than 90 days (amenorrhea)
10.  infrequent or sporadic menstruation 

Commonly women are prescribed various types of birth control pills or other sex hormone preparations to deal symptomatically with these problems, and thyroid function is not assessed. For further information on assessment of thyroid function, and the problems with standard medical practice in thyroid function assessment (Shomon  M, 2004), see Broda Barnes Research Foundation [http://www.brodabarnes.org/](http://www.brodabarnes.org/) .

### Conclusions {.unnumbered}

In mainstream health care, for the most part, reproductive life of women is designated into discrete healthcare segments - for example, contraception, teen pregnancy prevention, pregnancy achievement including reproductive technologies, pregnancy and childbirth, breastfeeding, perimenopause and menopause. Generally, there is insufficient interface between these segments in reproductive health promotion, education, and management programs, and a lack of which, de-emphasizes the importance of how one segment informs and influences the other. Additionally, women's general health care is, in most health care practices, treated separate from reproductive health, or there is little emphasis on how sound reproductive health is the fundament of robust general health. In a holistic approach to women's health all segments are treated interactively. Each segment radiates communicatively from a central focus, the unfolding rhythm of menstrual cycle events. For several years after menopause, women still experience hormonal fluctuations that mirror, in soft focus, the menstrual rhythms of their fertile years.  Women can learn how to recognize menstrual rhythms and the significance of them regarding health across their lifespan (Walker LO & Tinkle MB, 1996). 

Health care providers have the opportunity to influence and promote women's reproductive health.  The years between menarche and actively achieving pregnancy is the time for young women to be invited into mindfulness that their reproductive health and lifestyle choices now unequivocally influence future childbearing opportunities, as well as the healthy unfolding of the perimenopausal years. It is a time to emphasis that good reproductive health means good overall physical health, no matter how remote the idea of pregnancy may be or distant the vagaries of menopause might seem. The value of charting the menstrual cycle, is in learning how menstrual cycle irregularities signal concern for future fertility, pregnancy continuance and, long-term health.

The estimated time of ovulation (ETO) was correlated with the day of defined postovulatory infertility in 66 hormonally normal menstrual cycles from 24 subjects for each of 15 different natural family planning methodologies. Inherent weaknesses were identified in methods based upon calendar calculations or basal body temperature only. These weaknesses could be removed for the basal body temperature-only methods if symptoms, especially the peak mucus symptom, were added to the temperature records. However, the peak mucus symptom alone had the greatest precision of all methods studied. No advantage could be identified in combining the basal body temperature with the peak symptom.

The observation of the "Peak" mucus symptom in women using the ovulation method of natural family planning has been correlated with the estimated time of ovulation, as evaluated by indirect hormonal parameters. In 65 cycles of the 73 studied in 24 patients, there was hormonal confirmation of ovulation; in eight cycles, anovulation or luteal dysfunction was suspected. In the 65 normal cycles, 64 exhibited a Peak symptom. In those cycles, ovulation was estimated to occur from 3 days before to 3 days after the Peak symptom with a mean of 0.31 days before the Peak symptom. In 95.4% of these cycles, ovulation was estimated to occur from 2 days before to 2 days after the Peak symptom. The variation between cycles of the same patient ranged from 0 to 4 days with a mean of 1.8 days. The beginning of the mucus symptom preceded the estimated time of ovulation by an average of 5.9 days.

The goal of an integrative science of women's health is bringing together childbearing with women's health during the lifespan. Enhancing a woman's ability to conceive and maintain a pregnancy is influenced by decisions made well before the beginning of a pregnancy. Identifying ovulatory disorders makes it possible to intervene early in a young woman's childbearing years. Gynecologic charting typically used in natural family planning provides information to the woman and to the healthcare provider that is useful for diagnosis. If young women have a better understanding of fertility and menstrual cycle function, they are in a stronger position to make informed decisions about how they wish to manage their reproductive and sexual health. It may be possible to educate the young woman in health habits that will lead to a healthy pregnancy when she chooses and/or to treat the cause of the ovulatory disorder. This article focuses on polycystic ovary syndrome and hypothalamic dysfunction, which can cause menstrual cycle abnormalities in which gynecologic charting is useful in young women.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the day-specific and cycle-specific probabilities of conception leading to clinical pregnancy, in relation to the timing of intercourse and vulvar mucus observations.

METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of women beginning use of the Creighton Model Fertility Care System in Missouri, Nebraska, Kansas, and California. Data were abstracted from Creighton Model Fertility Care System records, including women's daily standardized vulvar observations of cervical mucus discharge, days of intercourse, and clinically evident pregnancy (conception). Established statistical models were used to estimate day-specific probabilities of conception.

RESULTS: Data were analyzed from 1681 cycles with 81 conceptions from 309 normally fertile couples (initially seeking to avoid pregnancy) and from 373 cycles with 30 conceptions from 117 subfertile couples (who were initially trying to achieve pregnancy). The highest probability of pregnancy occurred on the peak day of vulvar mucus observation (.38 for normally fertile couples and .14 for subfertile couples). The probability of pregnancy was greater than .05 for normally fertile couples from 3 days before to 2 days after the peak, and for subfertile couples from 1 day before to 1 day after the peak. The cycle-specific probability of conception correlated with the quality of mucus discharge in normally fertile couples but not in subfertile couples.

CONCLUSION: Standardized vulvar observations of vaginal mucus discharge identify the days with the greatest likelihood of conception from intercourse in normal fertility and subfertility and provide an indicator of the overall potential for conception in a given menstrual cycle in normal fertility.

**Stanford JB, White GL, and Hatasaka H.** **Timing Intercourse to Achieve Pregnancy: Current Evidence.** Obstetrics & Gynecology 2002;100:1333-1341

Physicians who counsel women for preconception concerns are in an excellent position to give advice to couples regarding the optimal timing of intercourse to achieve pregnancy. The currently available evidence suggests that methods that prospectively identify the window of fertility are likely to be more effective for optimally timing intercourse than calendar calculations or basal body temperature. There are several promising methods with good scientific bases to identify the fertile window prospectively. These include fertility charting of vaginal discharge and a commercially available fertility monitor. These methods identify the occurrence of ovulation clinically and also identify a longer window of fertility than urinary luteinizing hormone kits. Prospectively identifying the full window of fertility may lead to higher rates of conception. Proper information given early in the course of trying to achieve pregnancy is likely to reduce time to conception for many couples, and also to reduce unnecessary intervention and cost.

BACKGROUND: The likelihood of spontaneous conception in subsequent cycles is important for a balanced management of infertility. Previous studies on time to pregnancy are mostly retrospective and biased because of exclusion of truly infertile couples. The study aim was to present a non-parametric estimation of cumulative probabilities of conception (CPC) in natural family planning (NFP) users illustrating an ideal of human fertility potential. METHODS: A total of 346 women was observed who used NFP methods to conceive from their first cycle onwards. The couples practising NFP make optimal use of their fertility potential by timed intercourse. The CPC were estimated for the total group and for couples who finally conceived by calculating Kaplan-Meier survival rates. RESULTS: A total of 310 pregnancies occurred among the 346 women; the remaining 36 women (10.4%) did not conceive. Estimated CPC for the total group (_n_ = 340 women) at one, three, six and 12 cycle(s) were 38, 68, 81 and 92% respectively. For those who finally conceived (truly fertile couples, _n_ =304 women), the respective pregnancy rates were 42, 75, 88 and 98% respectively. Although the numbers of couples in both groups were similar, the impact of age on time to conception, as judged by the Wilcoxon test, was less in the truly fertile than in the total group. CONCLUSIONS: Most couples conceive within six cycles with timed intercourse. Thereafter, every second couple is probably either subfertile or infertile. CPC decline with age because heterogeneity in fecundity increases. In the subgroup of truly fertile couples, an age-dependent decline in CPC is statistically less obvious because of high homogeneity, even with advancing age.

PIP: In response to concerns raised by both Trussell and Ellertson et al., the authors (members of the WHO Task Force on Postovulatory Methods of Fertility Regulation) investigated the impact of time elapsed since unprotected intercourse on the efficacy of emergency contraception in more detail. Overall, the pregnancy rate increased from 0.5% when treatment was initiated within 24 hours to 4.1% after a time lapse of 61-72 hours. Postponement of the first dose by 12 hours increased the likelihood of pregnancy by almost 50%. A levonorgestrel-only regimen was consistently more effective than the Yuzpe regimen. A comparison of the pregnancy risk associated with levonorgestrel with that of Yuzpe in the 7 studies pooled by Trussell yields a relative risk of 0.3 (95% confidence interval, 0.23-0.97)--similar to that reported in the WHO study with other conception probabilities. Since the Yuzpe regimen has not been updated since 1973, it is time to review and improve emergency contraception options.

The objective of this review is to show how fertility awareness can be useful in the assessment of a woman's health. The main techniques for detecting ovulation are explained, and then the events that characterize a normal menstrual cycle are discussed. The relevance of cervical mucus from the perspective of female fertility is highlighted. Finally, the usefulness of fertility awareness 1) to identify fertile and infertile periods, 2) to help to detect several pathologies, and 3) in regards to how it exerts an important role in the success of programs in education for affectivity and sexuality are discussed.
